this is the final video where we'll be learning about the basic examples of spinners in physics in the last couple videos we've learned how both LightWave polarizations and Quantum spin States can be described mathematically by pairs of complex numbers called Spinners that rotate on a sphere with su2 matrices in this video we'll learn how to visualize Spinners as flag poles on a sphere and learn how Spinners are points on the complex projective line to begin let's review some of the basic facts about Jones vectors and Quantum spin State vectors a diagonally polarized wave is made up of equal amounts of horizontally and vertically polarized waves however if we phase shift the horizontally and vertically polarized Waves by the same amount all this does is shift the entire wave along the axis of travel the wave is still diagonally polarized so the polarization is unchanged so we know that multiplying A Jones vector by an overall phase does not change the polarization here's something else to consider if we take a diagonally polarized Jones vector and multiply it by two all this does is double the amplitude of the wave but the wave is still diagonally polarized so the polarization is unchanged so we've learned that multiplying A Jones vector by an overall scaling Factor does not change the polarization so polarizations are unchanged when we multiply a wave by any overall phase factor or any overall scaling factor and of course a scaling factor and a phase together can be used to describe any complex number this is just an alternative way of writing a complex number X Plus i y so polarizations are unchanged when we multiply Jones vectors by a complex number now let's look at Quantum spin states in the stern gearlock experiment we know that when we take a particle with a given spin State and apply an inhomogeneous magnetic field the particle will exit the magnet as a Quantum superposition of two outcome states that are split in the up and down directions I was a bit imprecise about this in my last video but the states doesn't fully collapse into the spin up or spin down state until a measurement is performed at a detector the probabilities for collapsing into a given state are given by the squared magnitudes of the inner product of the States before and after the collapse this is called born's Rule if we multiply our initial State vector by an overall phase and then look at the results of born's rule the complex phase comes out and has a magnitude of one leaving the resulting probabilities unchanged what this means is that any two State vectors that are related by a complex phase represent the same Quantum state so Quantum states are unchanged by overall phase factors now let's consider multiplying a Quantum State vector by the number two in many introductory quantum mechanics classes your professor might tell you that this is not allowed because this can give us probabilities larger than one when we use born's rule professors might tell you that it's required that all Quantum State vectors must have a length of one to ensure that the probabilities of all possible collapsed States add up to one however we can actually allow Quantum State vectors to have lengths larger or smaller than one if we make an appropriate change to born's rule this new version of Bourne's rule contains a division by the squared Vector lengths which normalizes both vectors to have a length of one with the newborns rule we can feel free to change the lengths of our state vectors as we like as long as they are non-zero because the newborn's rule will normalize them to one for us so if we multiply the first state vector by 2 we get a factor of 2 squared in the denominator which cancels with 2 squared in the numerator leaving the probability result from born's rule unchanged so it's only the angle between states that matters not the lengths of the state vectors so with the newborn's rule multiplying a Quantum State vector by an overall phase by an overall scaling factor or both leaves the state unchanged so both Jones vectors for light waves and Quantum State vectors in the stern gerlock experiment can be written as a pair of complex numbers and both of these can be multiplied by an overall scaling factor and an overall complex phase without changing the state they represent we call these pairs of complex numbers that don't care about overall complex multiplication spinners so we can write Spinners as a pair of complex numbers Alpha and beta these two complex numbers are made up of four real numbers two scaling factors and two phases this might make you think that Spinners require four real numbers to be specified but since we are free to multiply a spinner by any complex number without changing it we can always multiply by one over Alpha causing the top component to be one and making the bottom component the ratio beta over Alpha so really there's only one complex number that's required to specify a spinner since it is only the ratio of beta over Alpha that actually matters and this is a single complex number with two real parameters this is why we're able to visualize Spinners as arrows on a sphere only two real parameters are needed to specify them the longitude and the latitude the remaining two parameters the overall phase and overall scaling are ignored however we can still visualize the overall phase and overall scaling if we like using a flagpole visualization instead of drawing a spinner as an arrow on this sphere we can instead draw it as a flag on a flagpole the orientation of this flag on the flagpole represents the overall phase factor that we're ignoring we can also change the length of the flagpole to represent the overall scale factor that we're ignoring so that it can be less than or greater than one as long as it's not zero note that a specific spinner is only identified with the point where the flagpole meets the sphere so changing the angle of the flag and changing the flagpole's length do not change which spinner we're talking about we can see these factors mathematically if we write out our spinner as a combination of two basis Spinners each with complex number coefficients if we multiply and divide the second term by e to the I Phi 1 we can factor out e to the I Phi 1 from both terms and bring it out in front if we take the Spinner's magnitude to be M we can multiply and divide both terms by m then bring a factor M out in front the ratios A1 over M and A2 over M can be visualized on a triangle like this A1 over m is just the cosine of this angle and A2 over m is just the sign of this angle you'll notice that I've chosen to write this angle as Theta over 2. this is because in the original space the two basis Spinners are 90 degrees apart but on this sphere where we ignore overall signs they are 180 degrees apart so we need to take this angle on the sphere and divide it by 2 to get to the correct angle between the basis Spinners in the original space so we can rewrite A1 over M as a cosine and rewrite a 2 over M as a sign I'll also rewrite Phi 1 as Omega and rewrites the phase difference Phi 2 minus Phi 1 as just Phi so we've Rewritten our two component spinner like this and it has four real parameters M Omega Theta and Phi the Theta and Phi parameters determine where the spinner points on the sphere Omega is the overall phase and determines the angle of the flag on the flagpole and M which is the overall magnitude determines the length of the flagpole the Omega and M parameters can be ignored since overall phases and overall scaling factors don't change the spinner only the Theta and Phi parameters matter because they determine where the spinner points on the sphere as an exercise you can try calculating the Theta Phi and Omega parameters for this spinner of length one that's been rotated around and try checking that the flag orientations make sense so Spinners are pairs of complex numbers where the overall multiplication by a non-zero complex number doesn't change the spinner this probably seems very mysterious but there is a way we can understand Spinners better by realizing they are members of the complex projective line the complex projective line is a bit confusing when you first see it so let's start simple and look at projections in the ordinary two-dimensional space with real numbers which is the X Y plane let's imagine that we have a vertical screen at the position x equals one and we want to project points onto this screen one way to project points is to send them along parallel lines at right angles to the screen this is called orthogonal projection and it Maps the point x y to the point 1 y the y-coordinate stays the same but the x coordinate is forced to be one after the projection with this projection objects retain their true vertical sizes after the projection another type of projection is called perspective projection for this we put our I at the origin point and project all points in the plane towards our eye using radial lines the locations where these radial lines hit the screen are where the points end up after the projection with perspective projection the true size of objects is not retained after the projection objects that are farther away from the screen will appear to shrink more than objects that are closer to the screen with perspective projection all the points on this diagonal line through the origin will be projected to this same specific point on our screen we normally write the equation of a line as y equals MX plus b where m is the slope and B is the y-intercept however since our projection lines go through the origin we have b equals zero and so the slope M of the line is equal to Y over X this is true for any point on the line so all points on this line have the same y over X ratio if we look at the point where this projection line crosses the screen at x equals one we find that the Y value is the slope m so all X Y points on a given projection line get projected to the point 1 M where m is just the ratio y over X so the destination point will be completely determined by the ratio y over X this means that if we scale a point by some overall scale factor a it will not change its destination point after the projection all this does is push the point outward along the ray the scale factor will get canceled when we take the ratio between Y and X so it doesn't affect the final destination of the point after projection we call this space after the projection the real projective line rp1 now there are a couple of important details to consider with the real projective line one thing to consider is this point here on the y-axis where does this point get projected to on the screen tracing a radial line towards the origin the resulting Ray points downward parallel to the screen and goes on forever so this point doesn't get projected to the screen at all we say that points like this get projected to the point at Infinity any point with a zero x value will get projected to this point at Infinity because the Y over X ratio involves division by zero this point at Infinity can be reached by projecting downward along the y-axis or upward along the y-axis so there is a single point at Infinity that can be reached by projecting infinitely in either the positive or negative directions this point at Infinity sort of joins up both infinite ends of the screen so that it forms a continuous loop this idea of a point at Infinity might make you feel uncomfortable but this is a perfectly valid mathematical object in projective geometry it's just an extra point we include for projecting points parallel to the screen just remember that all X Y points with the same y over X ratio get projected to the same point on the real projective line and in the case of X Y points where the x coordinate is zero all of these are considered equivalent and are projected to the point at Infinity although keep in mind the origin Point does not get projected anywhere and is ignored for the real projective line the second thing I want you to consider is the left half of the plane behind our eye that's at the origin it's important to remember that points behind our eye will also get projected to the screen so if we look at this circle these two points on opposite sides of the circle will get projected to the same point on the screen because they exist on the same line on the origin any two points on opposite sides of a circle centered at the origin will get projected to the same point on the real projective line the projection can't tell the difference between the positive version of a point and the negative version of a point because in both cases the Y over X ratio is the same the projection doesn't care about overall scale factors of negative one so if we take a semicircle and project all of its points onto the screen we'll cover every single point on the screen including the point at Infinity watch what happens to the projected Point as we travel along this circle the projected Point goes off to infinity and then comes back after a half turn around the circle the next half turn on the circle corresponds to another loop on the real projective line so one turn around the circle corresponds to two full turns around the real projective line it's almost like the projection takes the circle and makes it curl around on itself so that it wraps around twice instead of just once so that's the real projective line we put a screen at x equals one and project all the points in the plane along radial lines connected to the origin the destination points are completely determined by the ratio y over X and so overall scale values don't matter points on the vertical axis are projected to the point at infinity and points on the opposite sides of a circle will end up projected to the same place because projection destroys the difference between positive and negative versions of points now it's possible to do this in higher Dimensions as well we get the real projective plane rp2 by projecting all points in 3D space radially from the origin onto a flat two-dimensional screen at x equals one in this case the resulting point on the screen only depends on two real numbers the ratio y over X and the ratios at over X we saw the real projective line is like a circle with opposite points made equivalent so it's like a semi-circle where walking off one end teleports you to the other end the real projective plane is like a sphere with opposite points made equivalent so it's like a half sphere where walking off the edge teleports you to the opposite Edge we can use a similar approach for real projective spaces in higher dimensions but let's get back to Spinners and consider the complex projective line the complex projective line is very similar to the real projective line except instead of dealing with a pair of real numbers that are unchanged by real number scaling we deal with a pair of complex numbers that are unchanged by complex number scaling unfortunately it's basically impossible to visualize a space of two complex numbers because this would involve four real dimensions but the mathematical reasoning works the same as the real projective line we project our Alpha Beta points onto a kind of screen located at Alpha equals one the position on the screen is entirely determined by the ratio beta over Alpha points that have a coordinate of alpha equals zero will get projected to the point at Infinity since this results in a ratio of beta over zero although we ignore the origin point when doing projections after the projection we can no longer tell the difference between the positive version of a point and the negative version of a point because they both have the exact same beta over Alpha ratio in fact we can't tell the difference between any two points scaled by an overall amplitude and complex phase because these also go away when we take the ratio beta over Alpha the flagpole sphere is how we visualize points in the complex projective line with one of the sphere's poles being the point at Infinity the ratio beta over Alpha completely determines the direction of the flagpole on the sphere we've seen this sphere called the point array sphere and the block sphere but in the context of the complex projective line we call it the Riemann sphere if we go back to the six main Spinners we've been looking at for the last few videos you'll notice that they are all completely defined by the ratio of their two components the spinner with Alpha equals 0 represents the point at Infinity I'll briefly mention Mobius Transformations which are General matrices that act on a spinner by treating the inputs and outputs as single complex numbers given by the ratios of the spinner components we get this function here called a Mobius transformation I'll talk about this more in future videos so we now have a good mathematical description of what a spinner is it's a member of the complex projective line in other words it's a pair of complex numbers that have been projected so that the overall scaling and overall phase Factor doesn't matter it's only the ratio of the two components that matter the result of this projection is that a single rotation in the original space before projection results in two full rotations in the space after the projection because in the projected space we can no longer tell the difference between the positive and negative versions of a point each point on the complex projective line is determined by two real numbers and so we can draw the points on a sphere determined by two angles Theta and Phi if we want to visualize the overall phase of a spinner we can view it as the angle of a flag that is spinning around a flagpole and the overall scaling Factor can be visualized as the length of the flagpole but neither the angle of the FLAG NOR the length of the flagpole change the location of the relevant point on the sphere and so they don't actually change the spinner so we've closed the first chapter of our journey into understanding Spinners we have a mathematical description of spinners that works and can be applied to two different physical problems but there's still more to learn we'll see later that we can write 3D vectors as two by two matrices that rotate with double-sided Transformations using a pair of su2 matrices if you're familiar with quaternions this is equivalent to rotating a vector with a pair of unit quaternions we're going to see that we can Factor this 3D Vector into a pair of spinners and each spinner will rotate with a single su2 Matrix in other words Spinners transform with a single quaternion instead of two quaternions we'll also see how we can find the higher dimensional analogues of the quaternions and su2 matrices for example in the four-dimensional space time of special relativity we'll generalize the quaternions to The Matrix Group sl2c which will allow us to do both rotations and reference frame boosts giving us six types of rotations for space-time spinners also I've left a few links in the description to other sources that discuss physical applications of spinners and the flagpole visualization
