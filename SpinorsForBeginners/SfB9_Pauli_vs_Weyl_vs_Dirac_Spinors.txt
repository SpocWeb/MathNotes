we're continuing to study Spinners from a mathematical point of view and in this video we're going to discuss the difference between Paulie Spinners vial Spinners and direct spinners the short answer is that powley Spinners are two component objects associated with 3D space vial Spinners are two component objects associated with 4D space-time and direct Spinners are four component Spinners associated with 4D space-time made up of a left chiral vial spinner and a right chiral vial spinner stacked on top of each other we've spent the last few videos discussing powley Spinners in detail in this video we're going to discuss all the differences between Paulie Spinners and vial spinners once we understand the two component file Spinners it will be very easy to understand the four component direct Spinners since a direct spinner is simply a pair of vial spinners to begin I'm going to give an overview of all the differences between Pali Spinners and vial Spinners and then I'll spend the rest of this video exploring the differences in detail in 3D space we calculate the squared length of a vector using Pythagoras's Theorem x squared plus y squared plus Z squared in 4D space time we instead calculate the square of the space-time interval s squared which is time squared minus the space component squared the length of 3D vectors is held constant during rotations done with SO3 matrices the space-time interval of 4D space-time vectors is held constant when we do Lorenz Transformations done with so13 matrices we can rewrite 3D vectors as two by two matrices called Pali vectors and we can rewrite 4D space-time vectors as two by two matrices called vial vectors Paulie vectors are rotated with double-sided Transformations with su2 matrices vial vectors are lorentz transformed with double-sided Transformations with sl2c matrices Pauly vectors can be factored into a pair of Pali Spinners and vial vectors can be factored into a pair of vial spinners the inner product of Paulie Spinners is Sci dagger PSI but the inner product of vile Spinners is side transposed times the Epsilon Matrix times PSI Pali Spinners don't have a notion of chirality but vile Spinners can be either left chiral or right chiral finally powley Spinners have two types of indices four Spinners and dual Spinners vial Spinners have four types of indices for the left and right versions of spinners and dual spinners to begin let's do a quick review of special relativity if this review goes too fast I've included some links in the description that cover special relativity more slowly in Galilean relativity a space-time diagram with time along the vertical axis looks like a sequence of photographs that change as we move up along the time axis we can change our frame of reference just by sliding these photographs left and right this means that light beams can have any speed and Galilean relativity because changing our reference frame will change the speed of light special relativity postulates that the speed of light C is the same in all inertial reference frames this means we need a new way to change our frame of reference that keeps these two beams of light unchanged the key to changing reference frames while keeping the speed of light constant is squashing space time along one beam of light and extending it along the other beam of light this change of coordinates is called a lorentz boost and it is given by this formula here it can also be written with hyperbolic trig functions so lorentz boosts are actually hyperbolic rotations you'll also notice I've written the time variable as the speed of light c times time this is a common convention in special relativity because it gives time units of distance which allows us to treat time and space together on equal footing in space time this brings us to the first Topic in this chart comparing length in 3D space to the space-time interval in 4D space time in 2D physical space we measure length using the Pythagoras formula involving a sum of squares x squared plus y squared equals r squared a curve of constant R is called a circle and R is the circle's radius in 2D space-time we measure a distance like quantity using the formula involving a difference of squares time squared minus space squared equals s squared where s is called the space time interval a curve of constant s is called a hyperbola unlike length squared which is either positive or zero s squared can also be negative when s squared is positive we call it a time like hyperbola when s squared is negative we call it a space like hyperbola when s squared is zero the time coordinate equals the space coordinate and this traces out the straight line Paths of light beams these curves have many different names such as null isotropic or lights like curves in three-dimensional space the squared length formula looks like this and in four-dimensional space time the space-time interval squared formula looks like this next we'll talk about the matrices used to rotate in 3D space and Lorenz transform in 4D space time in 3D space the squared length of a vector v is given by V transpose V a transformation r that keeps the length constant must satisfy R transpose equals R inverse we say R belongs to the group O three the three by three orthogonal matrices these include both rotations with determinant plus one and reflected rotations with determinant minus one if we want to restrict ourselves to rotations only we force the determinant to be plus one we call these Transformations SO3 the 3X3 special orthogonal matrices a rotation always pushes points along a circle in a plane which is defined by a pair of variables we can find all the basic rotation types by looking at all the possible pairs of coordinate variables which are x y y z and ZX so there are three basic types of rotations which are done with matrices involving cosines and Sines in 4D space-time the squared space-time interval of a vector W is given by W transpose ETA W where ETA is this Matrix called the mankowsky metric multiplying this out gives the familiar time squared minus space squared formula we saw earlier a transformation Lambda that keeps s squared constant must satisfy Lambda transpose ETA Lambda equals ETA we say Lambda belongs to the group 013 the orthogonal group in one time Dimension and three space dimensions if we want to ignore spatial Reflections we force the determinant to be plus one which gives us the special orthogonal group so13 if we want to forbid Reflections in time which swaps the past and the future we also need to demand that the top left member of the Lambda Matrix is positive this is called the ortho Cronus condition denoted with a plus these Transformations that keep s squared constant are called Lorenz transformations basic lorentz Transformations also take place in a plane defined by a pair of variables we can find all basic lorentz Transformations by looking at all possible pairs of coordinate variables these are x y y z z x t x t y and t z so there are six basic Lorenz transformations three of these are the 3D spatial rotations we've already seen the other three are lorentz boosts which move us to a new reference frame with some constant velocity in our s squared formula if we set time and the third space coordinate to zero we get the familiar equation of a circle and we rotate circles using cosines and Sines with matrices like these but we also have three boosts which match up the time variable and a space variable if we set two of the space variables to zero we get the equation of a hyperbola we transform hyperbolas with lorentz boosts also called hyperbolic rotations with hyperbolic cosine and hyperbolic sine these are given by these matrices here so let's start our comparison between Paulie Spinners and vial Spinners by talking about vial vectors with 3D vectors we found that if we replaced the basis vectors by Pauly matrices we ended up with a two by two Matrix called a Paoli Vector which is another way of representing a 3D vector for 4D space-time vectors we do something similar except we replace the time basis Vector with the identity Matrix which I'm writing as this fancy number one this can also be written as Sigma t or Sigma 0. this gives us a two by two Matrix representation of a 4D space-time vector I've never seen this Matrix given an official name so for this video series I'm going to call it a vial vector now how do we know this is the correct way of representing a 4D space-time Vector as a two by two Matrix well for Pali vectors when we took the determinant we got the formula for the negative squared length of the vector let's see what happens when we take the determinant of a vial vector we get two products which we can distribute and since these inner terms cancel we get time squared minus the squares of the three space components this equals the square of the space-time interval for this vector so this is a good indication that our vial Vector is the correct way of representing a space-time Vector as a two by two Matrix because its determinant tells us the vectors space-time interval now let's consider the double-sided transformation of vial vectors now we know that 3D vectors rotate with SO3 matrices and in video number six in this series we learned that we can do an equivalent rotation on Paulie vectors by acting on it with a double-sided transformation of su2 matrices the special unitary 2x2 matrices these matrices each do half the rotation and so they use half angles of theta over two it's worth asking if we can do something similar in space time we know 4D space-time vectors can be lorentz transformed with so13 matrices if we rewrite our space-time vectors as two by two vial vectors we can ask if there's a similar double-sided transformation that we can do to achieve lorentz transformations we knew that poly vectors were hermitian and so they should remain hermitian after a 3D rotation with a double-sided transformation involving matrices A and B this led us to conclude that b must equal a dagger the hermitian conjugate of a and so a Pali vector v is rotated using the transformation Ava dagger vial vectors are also hermitian and so if we do a lorentz transformation using a double-sided Matrix transformation the result should also be hermitian and we conclude we lorentz transform a vile Vector W using the transformation AWA dagger we also knew that the determinant of a Paulie Vector is the vector's negative squared length since rotations don't change the length of a vector we concluded that the determinant of the a matrix must have magnitude one we also saw that these double-sided Transformations allow for arbitrary phase shifts in the a matrix without changing the rotation result so it was always possible to pick a phase shift that sets the determinant of a to positive one the determinant of a vial Vector is the square of the vector's space-time interval which is unchanged under Lorenz transformations so we can also conclude that the determinant of a has magnitude 1. in the case of lorentz transforming vial vectors and we can force this determinant to be plus one using the phase shift property finally we observed that Paulie vectors had zero trace and we used this fact to prove that the transformation matrices on Pali vectors must be unitary however vial vectors can have non-zero Trace so we cannot guarantee that the matrices transforming vial vectors are unitary so poly vectors rotate with this double-sided transformation I'm going to rewrite the a matrix as U for clarity U is a two by two Matrix with determinant plus one so it is special The Matrix is also unitary so Paulie vectors rotate with special unitary two by two matrices also called su2 matrices vial vectors are lorentz transformed with a double-sided transformation and I'm going to rewrite the a matrix as L for clarity L is a two by two Matrix with determinant plus one so the Matrix is special but there is no requirement for these transformation matrices to be unitary so these are the special linear two by two matrices SL2 since we're dealing with complex numbers we often write a letter C to tell us that the Matrix elements are complex instead of real so vial vectors are lorentz transformed with double-sided Transformations with sl2c matrices in video number six we found that su2 matrices are defined by two complex numbers Alpha and beta this gives us four real numbers but since the determinant is plus one this gives one additional real constraint reducing the number of free parameters to three real numbers this corresponds to the three possible rotations in 3D space if we look at an sl2c Matrix we have four complex numbers or eight real numbers but since the determinant is forced to be plus one this gives us two additional real constraints where the determinants magnitude must be one and its phase must be zero this reduces the number of free parameters to six real numbers this corresponds to the three possible rotations and three possible boosts in 4D space time recall from video number six that we could get Su 2 matrices using these half angle formulas involving cosine and sine we just multiply the sine term by a pair of sigmas that indicate the plane of rotation we can do something similar for boosts but using hyperbolic cosine and hyperbolic sign and we multiply the sine H term using Sigma T which is the identity Matrix and the sigma for the direction we're boosting in now let's talk about factoring these two by two matrices into spinners with Paulie vectors we found that it was sometimes possible to factor them into a column and a row called Paulie Spinners with the column being a spinner and the row being a dual spinner there were multiple solutions to this factoring since we could always get a new solution if we multiplied the column by a number K and multiplied the row by 1 over k but the most straightforward solution is given by these formulas however we found this factoring could only be done if the determinant of the Matrix was Zero and in order for this factoring to be done we need either all the XYZ components to be zero or at least some of them to be complex numbers it's impossible to do this factoring if all the components are real and non-zero now let's try factoring a vial Vector into a column and a row which will require the determinant to be zero since the space-time interval formula contains both positive and negative terms it's possible to make the space-time interval equal zero using only real components so complex numbers are not required remember the space-time interval equaling 0 means the vector is null or isotropic also called light like since it points along the direction of travel of a light beam in space time so let's take a vial vector and assume its determinant the square of the space-time interval is zero we'll also assume all the components are real numbers in order to factor it into a column and a row we need to solve for these values a b c d multiplying the column by the row and comparing the results with the Matrix entries we get these four equations now remember all four space-time components are real numbers so time plus Z must be real this means that a times C must be real as well the only way for this to be true is if C equals the complex conjugate of a times some real Factor K1 we also know that time minus said must be real so D must equal the complex conjugate of B times some real Factor K2 looking at the other two equations we see that the right hand sides are complex conjugates of each other which means that the left sides must also be complex conjugates of each other if we sub in our formulas for C and D we can cancel A and B conjugate and that gives us K1 equals K2 since they are both real the real number K is just an arbitrary scaling factor that we can set to one basically if a vector points in a light like Direction with a space-time interval 0 multiplying it by a scale factor won't change the direction and it will still have a space-time interval of zero so we'll just take k equals one for Simplicity but we still need to solve for the complex numbers A and B iven these four formulas notice that if we add the first two together the time components add and the Z components cancel if we divide by two we get a formula for time in terms of A and B we can get an equation for Z if we subtract the two formulas instead and we can get similar formulas for X and Y by adding and subtracting the other two formulas so this gives us the space-time components in terms of the spinner components but how do we get the spinner components from the space-time components we can think of the complex numbers A and B as each being defined by a magnitude and a phase from equation one we see the magnitude of a is the square root of time plus Z likewise from equation 2 the magnitude of B is the square root of time minus said from equation 3 Let's divide both sides by the magnitudes of A and B which we can rewrite as these square roots on the right hand side on the left hand side a complex number divided by its magnitude just gives its phase combining the exponents this gives us the phase difference between a and b on the right hand side we can multiply the square roots to get the square root of time squared minus Z squared for a null Vector this also equals the square root of x squared plus y squared so even though there are four real numbers in this spinner we can only solve for three the two magnitudes and one phase difference this is because the four space time components for a null Vector only have three free parameters the fourth parameter is determined by the other three so we can only get three parameters for the Spinners any overall phase Factor will get canceled out when we multiply the Spinners together so overall phase factors don't impact the final results so we've successfully factored a null vial Vector into a vial spinner and a dual vial spinner from now on I'll label the components of a vial spinner as PSI 1 and PSI 2 with upper indices if we rotate a powley vector using a pair of su2 matrices and then Factor our poly Vector into a pair of Pali Spinners we see that the column spinner rotates with a single half angle su2 Matrix acting from the left and we see that our row dual spinner transforms with the hermitian conjugate of this half angle su2 Matrix acting from the right similarly if we lorentz transform a vial Vector using a double-sided sl2c transformation and then Factor it into a pair of vial Spinners we see that the column spinner transforms with a single sl2c Matrix from the left and the row dual spinner transforms with the hermitian conjugate of this sl2c Matrix from the right now let's talk about inner products Loosely speaking the inner product of two vectors tells us the angle between them and the inner product of a vector with itself tells us the vector's squared length the reason inner products are useful is that they don't change under rotations for example if we take the inner product of vectors u and v written U transpose V and rotate them both with an SO3 Matrix R since the transpose of an SO3 Matrix equals its inverse these cancel to the identity meaning the inner product is unchanged similarly if we take two Paulie Spinners PSI and Chi and take their inner product PSI dagger Chi when we rotate them with su2 matrices we end up with u dagger u in the middle and Since U is unitary U dagger equals U inverse so these cancel to the identity meaning the inner product is unchanged now if we take two vial Spinners PSI and Phi we might hope that PSI dagger Phi is unchanged under Lorenz Transformations but this turns out to be not true if we transform our vile Spinners with an sl2c Matrix called L this is not guaranteed to be unitary so this l dagger l in the middle will not always be the identity Matrix so this is not a good inner product for vial Spinners and we need a new inner product formula the inner product is often written as a row times a column but we can get more interesting inner products if we put a matrix in the middle between them for example the inner product in flat space time uses this Matrix here with a positive one and three negative ones along the diagonal this Matrix is called the mankowsky metric and is usually written as Ada we can try to find a similar Matrix Epsilon that goes in between a pair of vial Spinners which will give us a good inner product if I Lorenz transform the Spinners with an sl2c Matrix L and set the inner product equal to the original formula I end up with the constraint that l dagger Epsilon L must equal Epsilon it turns out that there is no Epsilon Matrix that will satisfy this formula for arbitrary l so it doesn't give us a good inner product however if I start over and use PSI transpose instead of PSI dagger I get the constraint L transpose Epsilon L equals Epsilon and it turns out this can give us a good inner product if I write this as a matrix equation where L has components Alpha Beta Gamma Delta and churn through the Matrix multiplications I get four equations constraining the components of Epsilon these equations must be true for any choice of Alpha Beta Gamma Delta as long as they're determinant equals one looking at equation one the right hand side only has the component Epsilon 1 1. this means Epsilon 2 2 must go to zero the middle term must also go to zero telling us that Epsilon 2 1 equals negative Epsilon 1 2. and finally Epsilon 1 1 must also be zero since the equation must be true for any Alpha so we have these constraints on the components of Epsilon the simplest solution is to pick Epsilon 1 2 equaling 1 which gives us this Epsilon Matrix here with components 0 1 negative 1 0. so we've determined the correct inner product between vial Spinners is PSI transpose Epsilon Phi where the Epsilon Matrix equals this so for two Paulie Spinners xai and Kai their inner product is Sci dagger Kai dagger is what we call the Dual spinner of xai the duel is like the left portion of an inner product if PSI is a column that lives in a spinner space then sideager is a row that lives in the corresponding dual spinner space we talked about this in the last video for two vial Spinners PSI and Phi their inner product is PSI transpose Epsilon Phi this PSI transpose Epsilon term is the Dual spinner of PSI again the Dual spinner is like the left half of the inner product if PSI is a column that lives in a spinner space then side transpose Epsilon is a row that lives in the corresponding dual spinner space so we know the vial spinner in her product must be unchanged after a Lorenz transformation so L transpose Epsilon L must equal Epsilon if we multiply both sides by L inverse on the right we can cancel L and L inverse and see that L transpose Epsilon can be replaced by Epsilon L inverse this gives an alternate way of transforming the inner product where the second half Phi transforms with L and the first half PSI transpose Epsilon transforms with L inverse we'll talk about this more later in the video it's also worth mentioning that the vial spinner inner product is anti-symmetric and gets a negative sign when we swap the order of the Spinners and equals zero when we put the same spinner in twice because of this the Epsilon metric doesn't measure lengths and angles like most metrics it is more correctly called a simplectic form but I won't discuss that in this video next I'm going to talk about chirality for Pali Spinners there's no notion of left chiral or right chiral Spinners but vial Spinners come in two types either left chiral or right chiral the reason for this is that Paulie Spinners transform with su2 matrices and there is only one version of su2 but vile spanners transform with sl2c matrices and there are two copies of sl2c matrices called the left and right representations and we can travel between them using complex conjugation I'll show you what I mean if we look at these two matrices you might argue that they are different Transformations one rotates in the X Y plane and one rotates in the YZ plane but another interpretation is that they are the same physical transformation just written in different coordinate systems in these visualizations the two physical rotations are the same but the coordinate axes are different to relate to the two matrices we can change coordinates with C do the rotation with r and then change coordinates back with C inverse the result of these three operations is the Matrix R tilde which rotates in the tilde coordinate system the same thing can happen with spinners we can have two different su2 matrices that end up doing the same physical transformation they only look different because the matrices are used in different spinner coordinate systems for example it's possible that you and U complex conjugate represent the same physical transformation just in different spinner coordinate systems to show this we just need to find a coordinate change C which satisfies C then U then C inverse equaling U complex conjugate if we write the Matrix Big C with entries A B C D and go through the Matrix multiplications we get four equations where I've written the determinant as capital D matching both sides of equation 2 tells us small c squared equals the determinant and a squared equals zero doing the same thing with equation three tells us small D squared equals zero and B squared equals the determinant plugging all this into the determinant formula tells us that b equals negative small C so our coordinate change Matrix Big C looks like this what this shows is that U and U complex conjugates can really be viewed as the same physical transformation but represented in different spinner coordinate systems it turns out that we cannot say the same thing for the sl2c matrices that transform vial spinners it turns out that there is no change of coordinate Matrix C which satisfies C then L then C inverse equaling L complex conjugate this means that if we take the sl2c matrices we're familiar with that do lorentz Transformations and then complex conjugate them we get an entirely new copy of sl2c which is not the result of a change of coordinates we call these two copies the left representation and the right representation left chiral vial Spinners will transform with the left representation and right chiral vial spanners will transform with the right representation so unlike Pali Spinners vial Spinners come in left chiral and right chiral versions finally let's go over the notation used for the components of vial spinners now this next section of the video will involve the placement of indices on vial Spinners unfortunately there are so many different index conventions across multiple sources that the conventions you see in this video will probably be different than the ones you find in a textbook so make sure to pay attention to the conventions of your textbook and how it differs from the conventions in this video so we've already seen that there are ordinary vial Spinners and dual vial spinners and now we're saying that there are left chiral vial Spinners and right chiral bile Spinners so there are actually four types of vial Spinners in total left left Dual right and right dual each of these transform in their own way let's say that when we do a lorentz transformation on space time the components of a left spinner PSI transform with an sl2c Matrix called l in this video series I'll denote left spinner components as columns with upper indices the left Dual of PSI is given by PSI transpose Epsilon remember this is just the other half of the inner product for vial spinners if PSI transforms with L from the left then side dual will transform with L inverse from the right remember the entire point of the inner product is that it stays the same under a lorentz transformation so if one half transforms with L the other half must transform with L inverse in this video series I denote left Dual spinner components as rows with lower indices if we take a left spinner and complex conjugate it we call the result a right dual spinner right dual vial Spinners transform with the complex conjugate of L in this video series I denote write dual Spinners as columns with upper indices that have dots on top if we look at the inner product of vial Spinners and complex conjugate the formula the second half PSI star transforms like a right dual spinner with L complex conjugate for the first half we can rewrite Epsilon Star as Epsilon since it's real and the complex conjugate transpose can be written as a dagger this must be a right spinner which transforms with the complex conjugate of L inverse this makes sense if one half of the inner product transforms with L star the other must transform with L star inverse in this video series I denote right Spinners as rows with lower indices with dots on top I've summarized all four of the different vial Spinners along with their transformation rules and index notations here this notation for the four types of vial Spinners that use both the dotted and undotted indices is called Van Der Varden notation now I should mention something else here I've written the various vial Spinners using a mix of columns and rows some sources prefer to write all vial Spinners as columns only to do this we need to take the transpose of the vial Spinners that I've written as rows so if we take this transformation and take the transpose of both sides this transposes everything inside the brackets and also reverses the order now the transpose of Epsilon is negative Epsilon but since we transpose Epsilon on both sides we get Negative signs on both sides that cancel out and we get this so keep in mind how the transformation rules change when we take the transpose so in the column only notation the four Transformations look like this the reason we refer to left-handed and right-handed Spinners is because they are related by mirror symmetry just like left and right hands we can reflect space in a mirror by sending the XYZ basis vectors to the negative versions of themselves if we do this rotation Transformations are unchanged because rotation in the X Y plane is unchanged when we reverse the X and Y basis vectors we can see this in our spinner transformation matrices as well because when we flip the signs on the two sigmas they cancel out leaving the Matrix unchanged when we look at how left and right Spinners transform we know that su2 rotation matrices are unitary so L inverse equals l dagger this means that right chiral Spinners rotate with l dagger dagger which is just L the exact same rotation that left chiral Spinners rotate with however when it comes to lorentz boosts boosts are hermitian not unitary if we take the hermitian conjugate of 2x2 boost matrices we get the exact same thing back the reason for this is that the Boost matrices only contain a single Sigma Matrix and the sigma matrices are hermitian when we mirror space this term in the lorentz Boost does change sign which is equivalent to reversing the angle in the Boost and giving us the inverse lorentz boost when we look at how left and right Spinners transform we know boost Transformations equal their own daggers so we can ignore the dagger here now we see that left and right file spanners transform in opposite ways when it comes to boosts which is what we would expect when we reflect space in a mirror if we go back to our transformation formula for a vial vector and Factor the vial Vector into two vial Spinners we see the first spinner transforms with L so this makes it a left-handed vial spinner if we take the second half of the formula and transpose it we see that this spinner transforms with L star which makes it a right dual spinner so a vial Vector can be thought of as the outer product of a left-handed vial spinner whose components are written with upper indices and a right-handed dual vial spanner whose components are written with upper dotted indices as seen in the last video if the vial vector's determinant is non-zero we can use the trick shown in the last video to break it up into a sum of four matrices and then Factor each of those into a pair of vial spinners so in general a vial Vector can be written as a linear combination of tensor products of left vial Spinners and right dual vial spinners in the last video we saw that a linear map called Sigma transforms a three-dimensional Vector into a powly vector which lives in the space of spinner dual spinner tensor products The Matrix entries of this linear map Sigma are here similarly we can also use a linear map Sigma to map a 4D space-time Vector to a vial Vector which lives in the space of left spinner right dual spinner tensor products The Matrix entries of this linear map are given here these are called the infeld van der Barden symbols as before we see that a single tensor index can be converted into two spinner indices using this linear map the last thing I'll mention in this video is Dirac spinners when dealing with spin one-half particles in special relativity we need to keep track of both left chiral and right chiral spinners when writing them both in column notation they follow these two different lorentz transformation rules it's possible to write the left and right Spinners stocked on top of each other like this as a four component column called a Dirac spinner the 4x4 Matrix which transforms this direct spinner is this blocked diagonal matrix here where the upper 2x2 block transforms the left spinner and the lower 2x2 block transforms the right spinner Dirac Spinners show up in the Dirac equation which describes spin one-half particles in special relativity including both the left and right vial Spinners allows for the description of both matter and antimatter spin one-half particles but I'm going to leave this discussion for later in this video series so to conclude this video I'm just going to review this chart of differences between the Pali Spinners of 3D space and the vial Spinners of 4D space-time in 3D space we measure physical length and we rotate vectors with SO3 matrices in 4D space-time we measure the space-time interval and rotate vectors with lorentz transformations so13 D vectors can be written as 2x2 Pali vectors that rotate with double-sided su2 matrices 4D space-time vectors can be written as 2x2 vial vectors and transform with double-sided sl2c matrices Pauly vectors can be factored into Pali Spinners which have this inner product and vial vectors can be factored into vial Spinners which have this inner product the concept of chirality does not apply to Pali Spinners and so we only have spinners and dual spinners but left and right chirality does apply to vile Spinners and so we have left left Dual right duel and right vial Spinners each with their own different transformation rules as an exercise you can take these vial Spinners and sl2c matrices and see how the matrices act on the Spinners as a bonus you can try drawing these Spinners on the Block sphere from video 5. also if we assume that these Spinners and matrices belong to the left representation try writing out the left Dual right duel and right equivalence for these Spinners and sl2c matrices
