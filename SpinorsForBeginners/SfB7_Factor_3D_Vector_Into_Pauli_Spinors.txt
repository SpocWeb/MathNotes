it's often said that a spinner is like the square root of a vector and I'll say that's kind of true but slightly inaccurate if you're thinking of taking an actual square root of a vector and getting a spinner that's not correct what is true is that we can take a 3D vector and cut up the vector into two pieces called poly spinners so it's better to say that a 3D Vector can be factored into a column spinner and a row spinner we're continuing with our introduction to Spinners in 3D from a mathematical point of view in the last video we introduced the sigma matrices also called the poly matrices we found that if we wrote a vector using the sigma matrices as basis vectors we ended up with a two by two Matrix called a polyvector which is an alternative way of writing a 3D vector just as we can take certain two by two matrices and write them as a column times a row it's also possible to take this 2x2 poly vector and write it as a column times a row this column and row are called poly spinners unlike traditional 3D vectors which rotate with a single three by three Matrix poly vectors are rotated with a double-sided transformation using special matrices called su2 matrices if we Factor our polyvector into a pair of poly Spinners then each spinner only transforms with a single su2 Matrix this explains why Spinners rotate half as much as vectors do before we start looking at Spinners let's review basic 2x2 matrices using array multiplication we can multiply a column by a row to get a two by two Matrix we just arrange them like this and follow the standard rules of array multiplication 1 times 3 equals three one times two equals two negative four times three equals negative 12 and negative 4 times 2 equals negative eight now it's also possible to do this process in reverse given this 2x2 matrix we can ask how to break it up into a column times a row you can think of this as trying to solve for these four variables a b c d if you like you can pause and try to figure it out but I'm going to give you the answer one solution is the column one four and the Row 1 100. however there are actually multiple possible solutions to this problem if we take our column row multiplication we can put a number one in the middle without changing anything we can then break up this number one into two times one-half multiplying the column on the left by 2 gives us the components 2 8 and multiplying the row on the right by one half gives us one half fifty this gives us another solution which also reproduces the same Matrix in fact we can multiply the column by any non-zero scaling Factor s and multiply the row by one over s and still get the same Matrix since the S and one over s will cancel with each other so there are an infinite number of solutions to this problem of factoring a matrix into a column and a row if we were to write this column as a b and the row as CD we could feel free to multiply the column by 1 over a and multiply the row by a to get another valid solution the resulting column has components one B over a while there are multiple possible columns that can solve the factoring problem the B over a ratio for all these columns is the same so when factoring a matrix we can get multiple possible columns but there is only one unique B over a ratio that solves the factoring problem so if you like you can convert this factoring problem into a series of equations and try solving for a b c and d since there are an infinite number of solutions you'll have to make a decision for what a should be before you solve for the rest of the variables now I should point out that not all two by two matrices can be factored into a column and a row for example this Matrix here with the 400 changed to a 500 cannot be factored if you try to search for ABCD numbers to solve this you'll find that there are no Solutions the reason this first Matrix can be factored is because the columns are all multiples of each other here the First Column multiplied by 100 gives the second column equivalently the rows are all multiples of each other the first row multiplied by four gives the second row in the specific case of a two by two Matrix these conditions are the same thing as saying the determinant of the Matrix is zero with this other Matrix The Columns are not multiples of each other and the determinant is non-zero so it cannot be factored into a column and a row now if we bring back our poly Vector let's try factoring this polyvector into a row and a column in other words we need to solve for these ABCD numbers this gives us four equations now let's keep a couple things in mind while we solve this first remember that there will be multiple Solutions because we can always multiply the column by a non-zero number s if we multiply the row by one over s also in order for solutions to exist the determinant of this Matrix must be zero recall from the last video that the determinant of a polyvector is the vector's negative squared length the negative of x squared plus y squared plus Z squared when a vector has zero squared length we call it an isotropic vector or sometimes a null vector keep in mind that the only way this Vector can have zero squared length is if all the components are zero or if at least some of the components are complex numbers getting back to factoring the polyvector since the squared length must be zero we must have Z squared equals negative x squared plus y squared if we take the square root of both sides we can pull the square root of negative one out in front as I now technically this square root could have either a plus sign or a minus sign in front and it would still satisfy our original equation but these basically correspond to the two different cases of a positive Z component and a negative Z component so I'm only going to look at the solutions with the plus sign in front of the square root if you want the negative Solutions you just need to change the sign of the Z component in the poly vector if we look at our first component equation Z equals a times C it would be useful if we could take our equation for Z over here and Factor the right hand side into two parts that way we can set one of them to a and set the other one to C to do this we're going to treat the expression under the square root sign as a difference of squares it's true that this looks like a sum of squares but we can turn a sum of squares into a difference of squares by changing the sign and including a factor of negative one here and negative one is really I squared and if we bring the I inside the same square as y we now have a difference of squares remember we can always factor a difference of squares into two terms the left term involving the first variable minus the second variable and the right term involving the first variable plus the second variable and for reasons of following convention I'm going to move the eye over here so we've successfully written Zed as a product of two terms and we can set these equal to a and C using our Solutions 4 A and C we can solve for b and d b ends up being equal to negative C and D ends up being equal to a so we've successfully factored our poly Vector into a column and a row and I'm going to call these two component objects poly spinners and I'm going to rewrite R A and B components as the Greek letters PSI 1 and PSI 2 with upper indices so just keep in mind that these are column indices and not exponents they're just labels that indicate where the component belongs in the left column I'm also going to mention that many sources include factors of 1 over the square root of two in these components and include a factor of two in front of the array multiplication to compensate for them but I don't plan on doing that so this is the solution we'll be using so we've discovered a solution to the problem of factoring a polyvector into a column and a row the components PSI 1 and PSI 2 are given in terms of X and Y by these formulas we can also solve for x y and z in terms of PSI 1 and PSI 2. now of course there are multiple solutions for these PSI components we can always multiply the column Spinner by a complex number with magnitude a and phase Theta if we divide the row Spinner by the same complex number for example we could always multiply the column Spinner by one over PSI 1 giving us the components one and the ratio PSI 2 over x i 1. so while there are multiple possible column Spinners that solve this factoring problem for a given poly Vector the ratio PSI 2 over PSI 1 will be the same for all the solutions this ratio is a single complex number in the case of spinners with a ratio where the denominator is zero these are related to the point at Infinity a concept from projective geometry I covered in video 5. this relates back to the two physical applications of spinners we discussed in videos two through five the polarization of light waves and Quantum spin States LightWave polarizations can be described by a pair of complex numbers one for the horizontal polarization and one for the vertical polarization the complex numbers tell us the amplitude and phase of each polarization overall scaling of the wave does not change the polarization and overall phase factors just shifts the wave along the axis of travel without changing the polarization so LightWave polarizations are unchanged by overall multiplication by complex numbers we also learned Quantum spin states in the stern gerlock experiment are described by a pair of complex numbers one for the spin up probability amplitude and one for the spin down probability amplitude the probability of state A collapsing onto State B is given by born's rule if we multiply State a by a complex number the normalization in the denominator eliminates the scale factor and the absolute value eliminates the phase Factor giving us the same probability result we originally had so Quantum states are unchanged by overall multiplication by complex numbers so both light wave polarizations and Quantum spin states are described by a pair of complex numbers whose states are unaffected by overall complex number multiplication in other words it is only the ratio of their components that matters this is similar to the poly Spinners we've discovered in this video where a given Vector produces a unique ratio of poly spinner components in mathematical terms when several Spinners have the same component ratio we do consider them to be different Spinners but they are all associated with the same Vector so they can be grouped together in a kind of family recall from the last video that polyvectors rotate with double-sided su2 transformations once we factor a polyvector into a pair of poly Spinners we see that each poly spinner rotates with a single su2 Matrix the column spinner rotates with an su2 Matrix multiplied from the left and the row spinner rotates with the same su2 Matrix but hermitian conjugated and multiplied from the right we also saw that Spinners describing LightWave polarizations and Quantum spin States rotated with su2 matrices on the poincare sphere and block sphere the reason su2 matrices are able to rotate a spinner PSI is that the Spinners squared magnitude is given by the hermitian conjugate of PSI times PSI when we transform PSI using a unitary Matrix U we can flip these around and cancel U dagger and U to the identity Matrix Since U is unitary and this gives us the same squared magnitude for the spinner so unitary matrices rotate Spinners around without changing their length now we've learned how to factor a polyvector into a pair of poly Spinners only if the vector's squared length is zero this is called an isotropic vector or null vector and either all the XYZ components must be zero or at least some of the XYZ components must be complex but what if the vector's components are all real and non-zero then it's impossible for the squared length to be zero we can ask ourselves if it's still possible to factor this polyvector into spinners it turns out that we can Factor it into Spinners if we use a trick let's go back to this Matrix with components 1 100 4 500 this matrix's determinant is non-zero and so we can't Factor it directly into a column and a row however we can write it as a sum of four matrices one for each of the four components where all the other components are zero then we can pull the numbers out in front as scaling factors so that the matrices are made up of only ones and zeros now all of these four matrices now have determinants of zero so they can be factored into a column and a row for example this Matrix can be factored into the column 1 0 and the row one zero we can do something similar for the other matrices so we've successfully decomposed this Matrix into a sum of column row products even though we can't Factor it directly into a single column and a single row we can still express it as a sum of column row products the same thing applies to poly vectors when a poly vector's determinant is non-zero we can't Factor it directly into a column spinner row spinner product but we can break it apart and write it as a sum of column row products with different scaling factors in front and these columns and rows are all poly spinners when we rotate the vector using a double-sided su-2 transformation the column Spinners will all transform with an su2 Matrix on the left and all the row Spinners will transform with a hermitian conjugated su2 Matrix on the right so to summarize the properties of poly Spinners they are pairs of complex numbers that we get when we factor a 3D polyvector into a column and a row there are multiple solutions to this factoring problem but there is a unique ratio of spinner components that solves the problem for a given vector this factoring can only be done directly if the vector has zero squared length which means it's an isotropic Vector also called a null vector for non-isotropic vectors we can instead break the poly Vector up into several matrices with zero determinants and Factor each one into a column spinner and a row spinner finally while polyvectors rotate with a pair of su2 matrices one on each side column Spinners and row Spinners each rotate with a single su2 Matrix as an exercise you can try calculating the polyvector XYZ components for these poly Spinners and check if they make sense in relation to each other
