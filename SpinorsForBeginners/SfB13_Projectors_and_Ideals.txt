we're continuing our discussion of how Clifford algebras can be used to build Spinners in a previous video I said that we can Define Spinners as members of minimal left ideals in Clifford algebras we've already defined what a Clifford algebra is and in this video I'm going to explain what a minimal left ideal is in the first part of this video I'm going to talk about projectors which are also called item potents and in the second part of this video I'm going to talk about how projectors lead to ideals I'm also going to give the definitions of some algebraic structures like rings and algebras along the way so let's begin by talking about projectors which are also called item potents I'll start by talking about projectors used on vectors and this should match up with your common sense idea of what a projector does afterward I'll use this idea to explain projectors in Clifford algebras which is a little more abstract let's say we have a vector v and some X Y axes and let's say I want to project this red vector v onto the x-axis this would mean we project V down along this dotted line onto the x-axis so that only the X component remains if I wanted to project this red V Vector onto the y-axis we project V across this dotted line onto the y-axis so that only the Y component remains now let's say I've projected a vector onto the x-axis and I want to take the result and project it onto the x-axis again our new result after the second projection is unchanged it's the same Vector we already started with so the conclusion here is that doing a projection once is the same thing as doing that projection twice converting this into symbolic language if we have a projector P applying P once should be the same thing as applying P twice so P equals P Squared this is the mathematical definition of a projection operator also called an item potent let's look at some examples of Matrix projectors this Matrix here projects out a 3D vector's Z component it sets the X and Y components to zero and leaves the Z component alone you can check that this Matrix squares to itself so applying it once is the same thing as applying it twice this other Matrix projects a 3D Vector onto the X Y plane so that the Z component is set to zero and the X and Y components are left alone this Matrix also obeys the same projector property now let's consider something else let's say we've taken a vector and we've projected it onto the x-axis now let's take the result and project it onto the y-axis the result is that there's nothing left we get the zero vector the conclusion here is that when we project a vector along two different orthogonal directions we get 0 as a result we say that two projectors p and Q are orthogonal if applying one and then the other gives us zero the two Matrix projectors we showed earlier are orthogonal if we project onto the z-axis and then project onto the X Y plane there's nothing left and we get zero and as expected when we multiply these two projection matrices we get the zero Matrix if we were to project onto the X Y plane and then project onto the x-axis the result is non-zero so these two projectors are not orthogonal and they do not multiply to give us the zero Matrix let's look at some projector properties if we have a projector P then one minus p is also a projector in the language of matrices we can think of one as just being the identity Matrix we can show that 1 minus p is a projector by showing that 1 minus P all squared equals itself as an exercise you can try pausing the video and proving this property as well as other upcoming properties before I give the answer after we distribute P Squared becomes P since p is a projector and here minus p and plus P cancel with each other this gives us 1 minus P which is the original projector so this shows that 1 minus p is a projector as an example if P projects onto the z-axis then 1 minus P would be the identity Matrix minus P which gives us this projector onto the X Y plane we can also prove that the projector's p and 1 minus P are always orthogonal to each other we prove this by multiplying the two projectors and showing that we get zero after Distributing P Squared becomes p and p minus P equals zero indeed the projector onto the z-axis and the projector onto the X Y plane are orthogonal and multiply to zero here's another property if p and Q are orthogonal projectors then P plus Q is also a projector again we can prove this by showing P plus Q all squared is equal to itself after Distributing the PQ product terms go to zero because they are orthogonal and p squared equals p and Q squared equals Q since they are both projectors and we get p plus Q as desired so for example a projector onto the x-axis and a projector onto the y-axis are orthogonal but if we add them together we get a new projector onto the X Y plane finally I'm going to give a definition a projector is called minimal if the projector cannot be written as the sum of other projectors so the X Y plane projector is not minimal because we can write it as the sum of other projectors but the projectors onto the X and Y axes are both minimal projectors because we can't write either of these as a sum of simpler projectors we'll see later in this video that minimal projectors are related to minimal ideals so to sum up a projector is an operator p with the property that p squared equals P two projectors p and Q are orthogonal if p q equals zero each projector P has an orthogonal projector partner 1 minus p the sum of two orthogonal projectors is another projector and a projector that can't be written as the sum of other projectors is called minimal also projectors are also called item potents item potent is just a fancy word for something that doesn't change when you apply it multiple times now what we've seen so far are Matrix projectors that act on vectors this should be pretty familiar to anyone who knows linear algebra next I'd like to talk about projectors in Clifford algebras specifically we'll look at projectors in cl30 which has basis vectors Sigma X Sigma Y and sigma Z that all square two plus one and all anti-commute with each other a member inside a Clifford algebra p is called a projector if p squared equals p let's take any unit Vector U in cl30 because vectors and Clifford algebra's Square to their squared length U squared equals one because it's a unit vector the expression one-half times one plus U is a projector we prove this the usual Way by showing that it squares to itself we distribute and Since U squared equals one we get two plus two U H factoring the 2 out we can cancel it with one of the factors of one-half and we get one half times one plus u which is the original projector as desired I'll call this projector p u Plus its orthogonal projector partner 1 minus pu plus is given by one-half times one minus U I'll call this projector pu minus so any arbitrary unit Vector U and a Clifford algebra will give us a pair of projectors p u plus and P U minus as a specific example we can look at the Z unit Vector Sigma Z if we look at the two by two Matrix representation of the sigmas we know that one is just the two by two identity Matrix and sigma Z is just Z Z power Matrix with entries 1 0 0 negative one this gives us these two projection matrices for p z plus and p z minus let's take these projectors and apply an arbitrary two by two Matrix to them from the left we see that pz plus has the effect of projecting out the First Column and setting the other entries to zero likewise pz minus has the effect of projecting out the second column and setting the other entries to zero notice that if we add these two projections we get the original Matrix back this is because when we add the two projectors together we get one back which is the identity Matrix which doesn't change anything through multiplication so when we add the two Matrix projections together we can factor out the original Matrix and sum the projectors to one which gives us back our original Matrix now here we've been looking at the 2x2 matrix representations of projectors in cl30 now let's look at abstract members of cl30 written out using symbols so given any arbitrary multi-vector element m in our Clifford algebra our projectors pz plus and pz minus can break M up into two pieces I'll call these two pieces m z plus and M z minus we can then add the two pieces back together to get the original M since pz plus and pz minus add to give one the same is true for any pair of orthogonal projector Partners they can always be used to break up elements into two pieces that can be added back together again to give us the original let's switch gears for a bit and talk about ideals which is a concept that comes up when studying rings and algebras Loosely speaking a ring is a set where addition subtraction and multiplication are all defined but we don't require division to be defined for example the integers form a ring because we can add subtract and multiply them to get more integers even though dividing two integers doesn't always give us an integer matrices also form a ring because we can always add subtract and multiply matrices division with matrices would be defined as multiplication with a matrix's inverse but since not all matrices are invertible we can't always do division with matrices but that's okay because division isn't required in rings the definition of an algebra is a vector space where addition subtraction and multiplication of vectors are all defined but we don't need division between vectors to be defined addition and subtraction come for free in Vector spaces but Vector multiplication is something extra that needs to be defined Clifford algebras are considered algebras because the Clifford product allows us to multiply vectors the wedge product from Grassman algebra's also allows a vector space to become an algebra now let's talk about ideals which are special subsets of rings and algebras an ideal is a special subset of a ring or algebra that's sort of like a black hole because ideals suck other ring elements inside of them so that they can't escape I'll show you what I mean let's take a look at the integers specifically we'll look at the subset of integers that are multiples of three so negative six negative 3 0 plus 3 plus 6 and so on the multiples of three are like a black hole because once we get inside it's difficult to escape adding any two multiples of three together will always give another multiple of three for example three plus nine equals 12 or 18 plus negative three equals fifteen also multiplying any integer by a multiple of three gives us another multiple of three for example seven times three equals 21 and negative five times three equals negative fifteen so the multiples of three are a special subset of the integers that's sort of like a black hole the sum of any two members in the set gives a result that's still in the set and the product of any integer with a member of the subset will result in another member inside the subset the generalization of this pattern gives us the definition of an ideal an ideal I is a subset of a ring or algebra where the sum of any two ideal members gives us another ideal member and the product of an ideal member with any other element gives us another ideal member the multiples of three form an ideal inside the integers because they satisfy both of these properties we can also look at ideals with matrices let's look at this subset of two by two matrices where only the First Column is non-zero this is an ideal inside the ring of two by two matrices if we add two matrices of this form we get another Matrix with only the First Column being non-zero also if we multiply a general two by two Matrix from the left onto a matrix of this form we get another Matrix where only the First Column is non-zero so these matrices form an ideal note that this multiplication trick only works if the general 2x2 matrix is Multiplied from the left it doesn't work if the Matrix is Multiplied from the right for this reason we call this subset a left ideal since the multiplication property is only satisfied if multiplication is done from the left if we look at the set of two by two matrices where only the top row is non-zero this ends up being a right ideal because the multiplication rule is satisfied only when matrices are multiplied from the right it turns out that any set of matrices with only specific columns being non-zero form left ideals and any set of matrices with only specific rows being non-zero form right ideals so we have this abstract definition of ideals but what do these ideal sets really represent inside an algebra to help give an intuitive understanding of what ideals mean I'm going to use a kind of metaphor or analogy you shouldn't take what I'm about to say to literally but it will hopefully help you understand what ideals mean in mathematics it's often useful to take a complicated object and cut it up into simpler pieces for example if we have a three-dimensional Vector space one way to cut it up into simpler pieces is to introduce some XYZ axes this allows us to take a vector and break it up into a sum of X Y and Z components when it comes to Rings ideal subsets are sort of like the axes of the Ring they allow us to break up members of the Ring into smaller more basic pieces for example in the ring of two by two matrices we can break up a generic two by two Matrix into two pieces one piece where only the First Column is non-zero and one piece where only the second column is non-zero each of these pieces represents a left ideal subset as we showed earlier these ideal subsets are sort of like the axes of our ring we can add pieces from our ideal subsets together to get any arbitrary two by two Matrix we could also break this ring up into right ideal subsets where only the top row is non-zero and only the bottom row is non-zero this can be thought of as a different pair of axes for breaking up our ring members into ideal components now this axis metaphor doesn't work for all ideals for example it does not work for the multiples of three inside the integers but the metaphor does work if our ideal is connected to a projector and here is where we get to the main point of this video where we bring projectors and ideals together if we find a projector inside our ring or algebra it turns out that if this projector acts on the entire ring or algebra the resulting set will be an ideal in other words every projector in a ring creates an ideal recall the two projectors we defined in the Clifford algebra cl30 which were pz plus and pz minus when we multiply a matrix M onto pz plus from the left we get a matrix where only the First Column is non-zero which is an ideal subset and when we multiply a matrix M onto pz minus from the left we get a matrix where only the second column is non-zero which is also an ideal subset so each of these projectors creates an ideal subset if we take the two projected ideals and add them back together we get the entire original space of two by two matrices this is again related to the fact that pz plus and pz minus add together to give one if we act on these projectors from the right instead we get the top row ideal and bottom row ideal instead which are right ideals let's go ahead and prove that projectors lead to ideals recall that an ideal subset must satisfy this addition property and this multiplication property let's take a ring r with two orthogonal projectors P1 and P2 where P1 and P2 add 2 1 and multiply to give zero we get the set i1 from multiplying the ring R onto the projector P1 from the left and so i1 is a left ideal let's first prove the addition property two ideal members must add together to give another ideal member if small R and small s are members of the Ring then rp1 and sp1 are in the set i1 basically any member multiplied onto P1 from the left is defined as being inside the set i1 adding these elements together gives us small R plus small s times P1 which is also in i1 by definition now let's prove the left multiplication property left multiplying any ring member onto an ideal member gives us another ideal member if small R and small s are members of the Ring then rp1 is in the set i1 if we multiply from the left by small s we get small s small R times P1 which is also in the set i1 by definition so this proves that i1 is an ideal the same reasoning can be used to show that the set I2 equals R times P2 is an ideal now an important fact is that two ideals i1 and I2 share no members except zero if their respective projectors are orthogonal in other words the intersection of Ideal sets i1 and I2 is just the zero element this makes sense with our axis metaphor of ideals where the only place two axes intersect is the origin or zero however this is just a metaphorical picture and we still need to actually prove this is true looking at our ring R the ideal i1 is a subset inside of R if we take a bunch of ring elements and project them using projector P1 they will all end up inside the ideal i1 let's take this element AP1 and give it the name small r remember projecting twice is the same thing as projecting once so projecting the ideal member AP1 again does not change its value in other words projecting an ideal member small R does not change its value now let's assume a ring member small R belongs to two orthogonal ideals i1 and I2 so projecting R using P1 doesn't change its value and projecting small R using P2 also doesn't change its value so small rp1 equals small rp2 multiplying both sides by P1 on the right P1 squared gives P1 and P2 times P1 gives zero since they are orthogonal so this means the projection of small R is zero which means that small R itself is zero since small R was already in the ideal this completes the proof that the only member i1 and I2 have in common is zero so the metaphor of axes for ideals is a decent visualization the only element that the axes have in common is the origin zero and the only element that ideals from orthogonal projectors have in common is the Ring's zero element finally note that it's possible for some ideals to live inside other ideals as subsets Loosely speaking this is similar to how we can project onto the X Y plane and also project onto the x-axis but the x-axis is a subset of the X Y plane if an ideal has no sub ideals inside of it we call it a minimal ideal minimal ideals correspond to minimal projectors which are projectors that cannot be written as a sum of other projectors let's summarize everything we've learned in this video projectors are operators that square to themselves and two projectors are orthogonal if they multiply to give zero ideals are special subsets inside rings and algebras that are like black holes because ideals suck other ring elements inside of them so that they can't escape addition and multiplication always bring us back inside ideals finally we learned that there's a correspondence between projectors and ideals and a projector that acts on a ring or algebra will always give us an ideal subset when we have a set of orthogonal projectors that all sum to one the resulting ideals act like a set of axes for our ring or algebra they break up the ring or algebra into its most basic components adding elements together from different ideals gives us more General members of the ring or algebra finally minimal projectors are projectors that cannot be written as a sum of other projectors these correspond to minimal ideals which have no ideal subsets inside of them we're going to see that elements of minimal left ideals and Clifford algebras correspond to Spinners in particular the two by two matrices with only the First Column being non-zero behave essentially like the Pali Spinners we saw used in quantum mechanics and the Jones vectors used in classical Optics that we saw in videos two to five however I'm going to need another video to explain this so in the next video I'll show how Spinners are members of minimal left ideals in Clifford algebras
