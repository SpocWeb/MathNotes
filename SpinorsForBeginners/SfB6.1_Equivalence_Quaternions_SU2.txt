in the last video I showed that instead of rotating a 3D Vector with a 3X3 rotation Matrix we can instead rotate it using a double-sided transformation we rewrite the vector as a two by two Matrix called a Paulie vector and multiply it on either side with an su2 Matrix on the left and the hermitian conjugate of that su2 Matrix on the right some viewers pointed out this looks similar to rotating vectors with quaternions which also involves a double-sided transformation with a unit quaternion Q on the left and that quaternion's conjugate Q star on the right these look even more similar if we rewrite the su2 matrices using half angle trig functions and the sigma matrices and rewrites the quaternion Q using half angle trig functions and ijk it turns out that the unit quaternions are mathematically equivalent to su2 matrices and in this video I'm going to show how first let's review quaternions hopefully you know that the imaginary number I is defined such that I squared equals negative one this allows us to write complex numbers of the form a plus b i where A and B are real coefficients quaternions are like an extension of the complex numbers where we have three imaginary units i j and k Each of which squares to negative one we can use these two right quaternions which have the form a plus bi plus CJ plus DK where a b c d are all real coefficients now with quaternions it's not enough to know that the imaginary units Square two minus one we also need to know how they multiply with each other the standard multiplication rules are I times J equals k j times k equals I and K times I equals J we can visualize these multiplication Rules by following the arrows on this circle for example if we do I times J we follow the arrows to get k if the multiplication goes against the arrows we get a negative sign for example J times I equals negative k this gives us an important property the quaternion imaginary units are anti-commutative this means that if we swap the order of multiplication of any two different imaginary units we get a negative sign in front so I times J equals negative J times I and so on we can also summarize the quaternion multiplication rules using this table however we can derive this entire table from just four simple formulas the first three formulas tell us that I J and K all square to negative one and the final formula tells us that I times J times k equals negative one all possible multiplications can be derived from these four rules for example if we take the last formula and multiply both sides by K on the right since K squared equals negative one we can derive I times J equals k I should also mention the idea of a quaternion's conjugate Q star given some quaternion Q we get the conjugate Q Star by switching the signs of the imaginary units i j k if we multiply Q by Q star we get 16 terms where only the diagonal terms are non-zero so we get a squared plus b squared plus c squared plus D Squared which is the squared length of the quaternion we say that Q star over the squared length of Q is the inverse of Q denoted Q to the negative one this is because Q times Q inverse gives us one now let's review the sigma matrices and how they lead to su2 matrices we already introduced the sigma X Sigma Y and sigma Z matrices in the last video the I and the sigma y Matrix is the complex number I that squares 2 negative one we already saw these matrices all square to the identity Matrix which I'm denoting with this fancy number one we also know that they anti-commute with each other so when we swap the order of any two different Sigma matrices in a product we get a negative sign in front so the sigma matrices look a bit like the quaternion imaginary units they anti-commute just like ijk but they Square to positive one instead of squaring two negative one here's the key to linking the sigmas with i j k a single Sigma Matrix will Square two plus one but a pair of different Sigma matrices will Square two negative one for example if we take Sigma x times Sigma Y and square it we get to the sigma's X Y X Y if we flip the middle two sigmas we pick up a negative sign which we can bring out to the front we're left with Sigma x squared and sigma y squared which both go to the identity Matrix so we end up with the negative of the identity Matrix we can use a similar proof to show that any pair of different sigmas squares to the negative identity Matrix it also turns out that these pairs of Sigma matrices also anti-commute with one another we can show this just by swapping the individual sigmas step by step and we end up with a negative sign in front so it seems like the quaternion imaginary units i j k might somehow be related to pairs of Sigma matrices and that's exactly right here's the correspondence between them there's an easy way to remember this the quaternion imaginary I is sort of like the x-axis and this is matched with negative Sigma y times Sigma Z which is sort of like the YZ plane which is perpendicular to the x-axis similarly J is like the y-axis associated with the perpendicular ZX plane and K is like the z-axis associated with the X Y plane to prove this equivalence we need to establish the fundamental properties of quaternions that each of i j k Square 2 negative 1 and that I times J times k equals negative one we've already shown that these pairs of Sigma matrices Square to the negative identity and the fact that we've added a negative sign in front doesn't change this result since negative one squares two plus one next we need to show the equivalent of I times J times k equals negative one if we replace i j k with our negative Sigma pairs we can multiply all three negative signs into a single negative sign out in front the inner pairs of Sigma Z's and sigma X's go to one and the remaining pairs of Sigma y's also goes to one so we get negative one as desired so these negative Sigma pairs are completely mathematically equivalent to the quaternion imaginary units in mathematical terms we say they are isomorphic so how does this fit into rotating vectors when rotating with quaternions we can write a vector v by replacing the XYZ basis vectors with i j and k so we get a quaternion with only pure imaginary parts and no real part we rotate V with a double-sided transformation involving a unit quaternion Q which is a quaternion with length one the real part of Q is cosine Theta over 2 and the imaginary part is sine Theta over 2 times the axis of rotation for example if we want to rotate counterclockwise around the z-axis we set the axis of rotation to K for the Q star on the right we take the quaternions conjugate which means reversing the signs of the imaginary units i j k here's a worked example of rotating the vector k around the J axis by an angle Theta using some basic trig identities we end up with some Vector that lives in the ik plane rotating from The Starting k-axis by an angle Theta you might also see this formula written with Q on the left and Q inverse on the right this formula works if Q is not normalized and has a length not equal to 1. the denominator for Q inverse forces both Q's to have length one if we want to do rotations with the sigma matrices instead we rewrite a vector v by replacing the XYZ basis vectors with Sigma X Sigma Y and sigma Z and this gives us our Paoli vector the double-sided transformation uses a matrix U which equals cosine Theta over 2 times the identity Matrix minus sine Theta over 2 times the plane of rotation for example if we want to rotate in the YZ plane in the direction taking y to Z we use Sigma y times Sigma Z for the Matrix on the right half of the double-sided transformation we take the complex conjugate transpose of U also called the hermitian conjugate of U denoted with the dagger symbol since the sigma matrices are hermitian and equal to their own daggers the daggered applied to a pair of them just swaps their order which is the same thing as introducing a negative sign so this is just the U Matrix but with the rotation angle working in the opposite direction so it's really U inverse so the dagger is basically playing the same role as the quaternion conjugate we saw earlier so it's really U inverse Since U dagger equals U inverse we call you a unitary Matrix another thing to note is that multiplying U by an overall phase Factor e to the I Phi will not change the rotation results since complex phase factors will cancel out as I showed in the last video this allows us to set the determinant of U to any complex number of magnitude 1 that we like so we set the determinant of U to be plus one by convention making it a special unitary Matrix su2 here's an example of rotating the vector Sigma Z in the ZX plane the math works out in a similar way to the example we saw earlier with quaternions so the quaternion rotation formula is written in terms of a rotation axis and the su2 rotation formula with the sigmas is written in terms of a rotation plane but both formulas are equivalent related by this equivalence so both unit quaternions and the su2 matrices give us a way of rotating 3D vectors using double-sided transformations these are both describing a more General concept called a spin group in particular these are two different ways of describing spin three the spin group of three-dimensional space 3 is what we call the double cover of the rotation group SO3 I mentioned before that we normally rotate 3D vectors using three by three matrices called SO3 matrices for every SO3 Matrix are there are two quaternions that do the same rotation if Q is a quaternion that does the same rotation as R then negative Q will do the same rotation since the pair of minus signs will cancel out in the double-sided transformation the same reasoning applies to su2 matrices for a given SO3 Matrix R there are two su-2 matrices plus u and minus U that will perform the same rotation so the unit quaternions or equivalently the su2 matrices are considered the double cover of SO3 rotation matrices because there are two members that will do the same rotation for any given rotation r if we want to learn to build the higher dimensional versions of the quaternions that do rotations in four five six and generally n Dimensions we need to learn how to build the spin and group we'll do this later in the video series when we discuss Clifford algebras also called geometric algebras in the next video I'll show that we can factor a Pali Vector into a pair of Pali Spinners where each one transforms with a single su2 Matrix so basically we can think of vectors as objects that transform with a pair of quaternions and we can think of spinners as objects that transform with a single quaternion
