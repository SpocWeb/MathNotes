this is the last main video in the series where we'll talk about representations of Le groups and Lee algebras in this video we're going to talk about the representation theory of SL2 C which is the double cover of the lorence group in the last few videos we studied representations of rotations in 3D space the standard 3x3 rotation matrices that rotate 3D vectors are the SO3 matrices these can be generated by generator matrices in the SO3 Lee algebra if we exponentiate them multiplied by an angle the SO3 generators follow these commutation relations an alternative way to do 3D rotations is to write the XY Z components as a 2X two po vector and rotate them using a pair of S2 matrices an individual su2 Matrix will rotate a two component object called a po spinner and su2 Le group matrices have their own 2x two generators in the Lee algebra su2 these generators are from the su2 Lee algebra and they obey the same commutation relations as s SO3 these sets of rotation matrices of different sizes are called representations of the Le group su2 and their generators are representations of the Le algebra su2 in previous videos we found that there was one representation of su2 per Dimension n which can also be labeled by the Spin number J which equals the dimension minus1 / 2 now we want to move to space time where Lorent Transformations keep the SpaceTime metric constant the standard 4x4 lorence transformation matrices that transform 4D space time vectors form the lorence group s so +13 these involve three rotations one for each spacal plane and three boosts for changing inertial frames one for each spatial Direction these 4x4 Lorent transformation matrices can be generated using these six generators from the Lee algebra s so +13 the rotation generators are labeled by J with two subscripts that indicate the plane of rotation the Boost generators are labeled by K with one time subscript and one space subscript indicating the Boost Direction sometimes these generators are all labeled by the same letter like M or S since the subscripts make it clear what they generate it's also common to label rotation generators with a single index for the axis they rotate around and label boost generators with a single index for the direction they boost in these generators from the lorence algebra obey these commutation relations one thing I was not very clear about in previous videos is that boost generators can have either a plus sign or a minus sign in front of them both versions satisfy the expected commutation relations for the lorence algebra we can move from one sign convention to the other just by doing a change of coordinates where we reverse the signs of the XY Z coordinates this is like reflecting the universe in a kind of three-dimensional mirror this change of coordinates leaves rotations unchanged since reversing both directions in a plane does not change the direction of rotation but this will reverse the direction of boosts this applies for both the Boost generators in the Lee algebra and the Boost matrices in the Lee Group which will boost in opposite directions an alternative way to do Lorent Transformations is to write the time XY Z components as a 2X two vile vector and transform them using a pair of SL2 C matrices these are the six Lorent Transformations on 4D SpaceTime vectors written as double-sided SL2 C Transformations an individual SL2 C Matrix will Lorent transform a vile spinner and and here are the SL2 C generators these sets of matrices are representations of the Le group SL2 C and their generators are representations of the Lee algebra SL2 C now before with the matrices that transformed vectors we saw that boost generators could have either plus signs or minus signs but we could swap between them using a change of vector coordinates so these are equivalent Matrix representations of the lorence algebra with the matrices that transform Spinners the Boost generators can also have either plus signs or minus signs in front the commutation relations work in both cases however we cannot swap between the two cases using a change of spinner basis so the generators with negative boosts and positive boosts are actually from two different Matrix representations of the lorence algebra ra called the left chyal and right chyal spin 1/ half representations the rotations are the same but the boosts are reversed this applies to the Lee algebra as well as the Lee group the fact that these left and right representations exist is related to the fact that the irreducible representations of SL2 C are labeled by two spin values so we we end up with a two-dimensional table of irreducible representations with all possible pairs of spin values one consequence of this is that there are two types of spinners in SpaceTime left chyro Spinners and right chyro Spinners but there are many other irreducible representations as well for the rest of this video we're going to explain how to get this table of SL2 C representations and talk about how some of the representation relate to objects in physics like four vectors the electromagnetic tensor and the metric tensor so in SL 2C we have six generators three rotation generators denoted by J's and three boost generators denoted by K's here I'm using the notation where the J index gives the rotation axis and the K index gives the Boost Direction the commutate of two rotation generators gives a rotation generator the commutator of two boost generators gives a rotation generator and the commutator of a rotation and a boost generator gives a boost generator all other commutators not listed here go to zero we can take these six basis generators and change basis by defining the A's which are a rotation generator plus I times the corresponding boost generator ided two we can Define the be's in the same way but with the signs in front of the Boost generators changed to be negative note that since we're allowing complex coefficients in these linear combinations we've actually switched to the complexified version of the SL2 C Le algebra which is denoted with this subscript C in this new basis the A's follow these commutation relations the B's follow these commutation relations and the A's and B's commute with each other so in this basis the commutators split nicely into two separate families each of these two families is equivalent to an su2 Lee algebra because these are the same commutation relations seen with su2 as seen in video 18 whenever we have an su2 Lee algebra we can change bases to get a raising operator a lowering operator and an igen value operator according to these definitions since these definitions involve complex numbers these operators belong to complexified su2 Lee algebras this change of basis from the J's and K's to the A's and B's means the complexified SL2 C Le algebra is equivalent to the direct sum of two complexified su2 Le algebras if we have a loren transformation L from the group SL2 C we can write the lorence transformation L as an exponential of the generators in the SL2 C Le algebra so we have a linear combination containing the J rotation generators multiplied by circular angles and the K boost generators multiplied by hyperbolic angles we can also write this linear combination using the notation where the J and K generators only have one index we can change this basis to the A's and B's as I showed earlier where each generator gets its own coefficient beside it since this change of basis involves complex coefficients we're now in the complexified SL2 C algebra we can now change basis once again to the latter and igen value operators and each of the these are a complexified su2 algebra so here we can clearly see that the complexified SL2 C algebra is equivalent to the direct sum of a pair of complexified su2 algebras this is made obvious when we do this simple change of basis now recall that if leag group members X and Y commute then we can use the property where the exponential of a sum becomes the product of exponentials so if we take the exponential of a linear combination of our SL2 C generators since the A and B generators commute with each other we can rewrite this as a product of two exponentials one containing the a copies of su2 generators and the other containing the B copies of su2 generators what this means is we can always write a complexified SL2 C group member L as the product of two Le group elements UA and U which are each generated from complexified S2s because their generators commute the A and B group members also commute with each other so if we have two Lorent matrices L1 and L2 we can decompose each of them into a product of uas and U's if we compose the L's because the A and B versions of the use commute with each other we can swap these elements and up with a product of uas times a product of U's so we can write a complexified lorence group element as an ordered pair of complexified su2 group elements and when multiplying group elements together the a elements and B elements just slide past each other and multiply with themselves because of this we say the complexified lorence group can be written as the direct product of complexified su2 subgroup groups this direct product symbol indicates members from the two subgroups are written as ordered pairs where the left elements multiply with left elements and right elements multiply with right elements incidentally this is exactly the property that the tensor product follows when we compose a pair of tensor product elements together so so far we've been discussing the abstract properties of the lorence group and lorence algebra but now I'd like to talk about their Matrix representations a matrix representation row of the complexified lorence group will map every group element to an invertible N byn Matrix since the group elements can be decomposed into a product we can also decompose The Matrix representation into a tensor product of a left representation row L for the a elements and a right representation row r for the B elements and remember to get the generator of a tensor product of group matrices we take the derivative using product rule then set the parameter to zero and we get this formula here with the sum of two tensor products involving generator matrices so a Lee algebra representation Pi will map complexified SL2 C generators to n byn matrices as we saw if we have a tensor product representation we can take the generators of the various algebra elements and represent them using this formula okay so I realize we've been dealing with a lot of abstract math and we'll get to examples soon but let's sum up everything we've learned the complexified Lorent algebra can be broken up into the direct sum of a pair of complexified su2 algebras that commute with each other as a result the complexified Lorent group elements can be written as the product of a pair of complexified su2 group elements as a result Matrix representations of the lorence group can be written as the tensor product of two complexified su2 group representations called the left and right representations and Lorent algebra representations are given by this formula so in order to get an irreducible representation of the lorence algebra we need to pick two irreducible su2 representations one for the left term and one for the right term we already know there is exactly one irreducible su2 representation per Dimension so we can label the lorence algebra representations by two integers M and N which are the dimensions of the left and right representations respectively we can also also label these by the Spin numbers JL and Jr which are equal to the dimensions -1 / 2 I also want to clarify the difference between the dimension of a Lee algebra and the dimension of a Lee algebra representation the dimension of a Lee algebra is just the number of independent generators in the algebra so SL2 C is a six-dimensional algebra because it has six generators which act as the six basis vectors for the vector space similarly su2 is a three-dimensional Lee algebra because it has three generators the dimension of a representation however is the size of the matrices used in a matrix representation so while the SL2 C Le algebra is always a six-dimensional algebra its Matrix representations can have different dimensions like 1 2 3 and so on so this direct sum here indicates we are combining two sets of three-dimensional Lee algebra generators into a space with six generators whereas this tensor product indicates we are taking the tensor product of representation matrices thus multiplying the dimensions of the representation spaces Okay so let's start looking for Matrix representations of the J rotation and K boost generators we know the formulas for the A's and B's and we can reverse these formulas to solve for J and K if we have a matrix representation row of a rotation Matrix generated by J we can rewrite J in terms of A and B since A and B commute we can split this into a product of exponentials as we explained previously we can write these commuting group members as an ordered pair and the Matrix representation can be written as a tensor product of a left representation row L for the left group member and a right representation row R for the right group member to get the generator representation matrices we take the derivative and set the parameter to zero the derivative gives product rule over the tensor product and after we set the parameter to zero these terms become generators in The Matrix representations denoted by pi and these terms become identity matrices we can get a similar formula for boosts except the formula has a minus sign in the middle and is multiplied by an overall factor of netive I it's worth noting that while the A's and B's live in the complexified SL2 C Le algebra because of the complex coefficients the J's and K's live in the real version of SL2 C and coefficients are assumed to be real so we have these formulas for the J and K generator Matrix representations we just need to pick su2 EPS for pi L and pi r we can say the left representation will have Dimension M with spin JL and the right representation will have Dimension n with spin Jr so now the matrices on the left side of the tensor products have size M and the matrices on the right side of the tensor products have size n and the Matrix representations of the J's and Ks are denoted by two integers M and N alternatively we can denote it by two spin values JL and Jr now we can start exploring this table of eps by choosing different combinations of Dimensions M and N or spin values JL and Jr the scalar representation is where the dimensions M and N are both equal to one in terms of the spins both the left and right spin values are zero the 1 by one or spin zero representation of any su2 Matrix is the 1ex one Matrix containing a zero so for the m = 1 Nal 1 representation of a rotation generator J when we subin our representation matrices these zero matrices make both terms in the sum go to zero so we end up with just a zero Matrix the same is true for the representations of the Boost matrices so for the m equals 1 Nal 1 representation of SL2 C all the generator matrices are zero when we exponentiate these generator matrices to get matrices in the Le group SL2 C we just get one by one identity matrices what this means is that particles which transform under this representation are completely unchanged by rotations and boosts these Transformations are equivalent to just multiplying by one for this reason objects that transform under this representation are called scalers they look the same in all reference frames now let's look at the spin 1/2 representations for su2 the spin 1/2 EP also called the 2x2 EP matrices are given by neg a half * pairs of poi matrices let's look at the m = 2 N = 1 in terms of spins this is the 1 12 comma 0 EP for rotation matrices since the second term in the sum is the 1 by one EP it goes to zero and can be ignored for the first term we have our 2x two EP tensored with the 1x1 identity Matrix this tensor operation leaves the 2x2 matrix unchanged so we're just left with our standard 2x two ER for boosts we get something similar except there's a factor of negative I in front of The Matrix so in this EP rotation generators are given by su2 and boost generators are given by negative I * su2 we know su2 generators are just - one2 time pairs of Sigma matrices for boosts we multiply by NE I but there's a property for the sigma matrices where if we multiply a pair of sigmas * I we just get the third Sigma so the Boost matrices are just - one2 times an individual Sigma corresponding to the Boost Direction so these are the generators for the m = 2 Nal 1 and when we exponentiate them we get these rotation and boost matrices particles that transform under this representation are called vial Spinners specifically left chyro vial Spinners now this is not the only spin 1/2 representation we can also look at the m = 1 n = 2 EP in terms of spins this is the 0 comma 1 12 EP if we look at the formula for the rotation generators this time the first term in the sum goes to zero once again we're left with an su2 representation this time we're representing the B generators instead of the a generators but since the A's and B's both denote su2 generators this is still the 2x2 su2 representation however with the Boost formula the first term goes to zero and the second term contains a minus sign this cancels with the minus sign out in front and we get multiplication by plus I this has the opposite sign compared to what we saw for boosts in the left chyal representation so in this EP rotation generators are given by su2 and boost generators are given by plus I * su2 the generators and their lorence Transformations look like this these transform right chyro vial Spinners so we have two different spinner representations of the lorence group the rotation generators are the same in both cases but the Boost generators have opposite signs we call these the left chyal and right chyal spinner representations now it's important to note that we cannot swap between the left and right chyal representations using a change of spinner basis I proved this in video 9 so these two representations are not equivalent representations the left and right chyal particles they transform are indeed different however we can swap between these two representations by changing the signs of all the sigmas the rotation generators are unchanged since the two negative signs cancel but the Boost generators do change sign so we can think of the left and right chyro representations as being related to each other by reflecting the universe in a three-dimensional mirror where the XY Z coordinates are all sent to their negative versions the same rule applies to the s l2c Le group matrices that we get by exponentiating the generators the rotations are the same but the boosts have their signs reversed if we take the direct sum of the left and right spinner representations the left and right chyro vial Spinners stack on top of each other and give us a dra spinner dra Spinners transform with 4x4 block diagonal matrices consisting of a left Kyro SL2 C block and a right chyro SL2 C block also if we take the four gamma matrices written in the vile or chyal basis and multiply them all together along with the complex I we get a new Matrix which is normally called gamma 5 if we multiply gamma 5 by a direct spinner with only the left components non zero we get that same direct spinner * -1 and if we multiply gamma 5 by a direct spinner with only the right components non zero we get that same direct spinner time + one so left and right vile Spinners are the minus1 and + one igen spaces of the gamma 5 operator we can also use gamma 5 to define the left and right projectors PL and PR these projectors Square to themselves and add to one they can project out the left and right components of a direct spinner which can then be added together again to give the original direct spinner now let's look at the m = 2 n = 2 representation in terms of spins this is the 1 12 comma 1/2 representation this is the representation that transforms 4D SpaceTime vectors when looking at the formulas for rotation generators both the SU two generators and the identity matrices are 2x two and so their tensor products result in 4x4 matrices the same is true for Boost generators now to get the actual group representation matrices that do Lorent Transformations we need to exponentiate these generator matrices before I do that I want to go over a few properties if we have a formula of the form a Tor identity applied to Identity tensor B then by tensor product rules we can apply first to first and second to second to get a tensor B this also equals identity tensor B applied to a tensor identity so the two terms commute with each other next if we exponentiate a tensor identity we get an infinite Series in powers of a tensor identity if we look at the squared term and do the application we end up with a squared tensor identity so really the nth power of this expression is just a to the N tensor identity this means that in our exponential series we can move the exponent to the a then use the tensor product rules to apply the scalers to the A and also factor out the identity from the right in all terms in the sum so we end up with an exponential series tensored with the identity which means the whole thing is equal to e to the a tensor identity we get a similar expression for the exponential of identity tensor B using these properties we can now take the rotation generator representation formula and exponentiate it we know these two terms in the sum commute so we can rewrite it as a product of exponentials note that the tensor product rules require that we pass the scalar Theta to only one term in the tensor product now we can apply the exponentials to the A and B representations then apply first to first and second to Second and we get this tensor product as the final result we get a similar formula for boosts except the signs and the exponentials are reversed so given these SL2 C algebra IR formulas we get these SL2 C group gr formulas this shows the SL2 C group ER matrices can be factored into a tensor product of complexified su2 matrices so for our m = 2 Nal 2 EP of the SL2 C group we get a tensor product of left and right 2x two complexified S2s now since complexifying the argument of an su2 rotation Matrix gives a boost these two matrices are equivalent to to left and right 2x two SL2 C matrices so this tensor product property is a bit abstract so let's look at how this works out with actual Matrix components we know the left spinner Lorent algebra representation has these six matrices the anti- Herm Mission rotation generators give unitary rotation matrices and the Herm Mission boost generators give Herm Mission boost matrices the right spinner representation matrices are the same but the boosts go in the opposite direction in other words these are the inverses of the left boost matrices now if we take an S2 C Matrix L and take its Herm Mission conjugate then take its inverse for the unitary rotation matrices since the inverse is the hermiss conjugate the combination of hermiss conjugate and inverse operations cancel out and the Matrix is unchanged but for Boost matrices which are Herm Mission the Herm Mission conjugate does nothing so we're left with just the inverse which reverses the Boost Direction so if a matrix L belongs to the left spinner representation of SL2 C then the Herm Mission conjugate inverse of L belongs to the right spinner representation of SL2 C again this operation leaves rotations the same but reverses the boosts now in video 9 I also introduced a kind of scalar product for vial Spinners which uses this Epsilon Matrix this product is left unchanged by Lorent Transformations which leads to the property that L transpose Epsilon L equals Epsilon this can be Rewritten in a number of ways if we look at this scaler product we can identify this sigh as a left vial spinner and identify s transpose Epsilon as a left Dual vial spinner if we complex conjugate this entire formula we can identify s transpose conjugate Epsilon as a right vial spinner and identify s conjugate as a right dual vial spinner so we previously talked about the left and right spinner representations so where do these dual left and dual right Spinners come from it turns out these are not from new representations we can flip between the left and left Dual Spinners by invoking the transpose and using Epsilon as a change of spinner coordinates Matrix the same is true for changing between the right and right dual Spinners so the Dual spinner representations are are not new they're ultimately just a change of coordinates from the spinner representations we already know for matrices the change of coordinates is done by using multiplication by Epsilon and Epsilon inverse on either side so the left and left Dual representations are equivalent and the right and right dual representations are equivalent using the algebraic properties we've learned so far we can deduce that taking a left chyu SL2 C Matrix L and complex conjugating it gives the corresponding right chyal dual SL2 C Matrix this is a fact we'll keep in mind for later remember we can rewrite A four-dimensional Spacetime Vector as a vial Vector which is lorence transformed using an SL2 C Matrix L on one side and El dger on the other side if we take this double-sided Loren transformation formula and turn through the Matrix multiplications to get four equations we can summarize all the coefficients using this 4x4 Matrix this 4x4 Matrix is really just the tensor product of a left SL2 C Matrix L and its complex conjugate which remember is the corresponding SL2 C Matrix from the Dual right representation which is equivalent to the right representation under a change of coordinates now this 4D SpaceTime Vector has all the components mixed together but we can separate them using this change of coordinates Matrix C we can then take our 4x4 Matrix and change coordinates using C and C inverse on either side to get a lorence matrix which transforms familiar 4D SpaceTime vectors so when we tensor the left spinner and right spinner representations of SL2 C together we really do get a 4x4 lorence group representation which transforms 4D SpaceTime vectors so the tensor product of the left spinner representation and the right spinner representation really does give us the vector representation now let's look at the m = 3 n = 1 representation in terms of spins this is the one comma 0 representation the 3D representation of su2 matrices is the same as the case of the generators for standard 3 by3 rotation matrices as we saw before when one of the representations is 1 by one its term in the sum goes to zero and the tensor product with the 1ex one identity doesn't change the result so we end up with the standard 3x3 rotation generators and for boosts we just multiply them by I now for the m = 1 n = 3 representation in terms of spins this is the 0 comma 1 representation we get the exact same thing as before except now it's the first term in the sum that goes to zero and as a result for the boosts we get multiplication by plus I instead so once again we've ended up with left and right representations where the rotations are the same but the boosts are reversed with opposite signs these are the left spin one representation and the right spin one representation the six Lee algebra generators are 3x3 matrices and they can be exponentiated into these 3x3 Le group matrices but what do these correspond to physically well if we combine the two representations together using the direct sum we get a six-dimensional representation which transforms the six components of the electromagnetic field also called the Faraday tensor vectors in 4D SpaceTime have four components but the electromagnetic field has six components this is because the electromagnetic field is not a vector it's a bi Vector in 4D space time there are six different ways we can group pairs of basis vectors together into B VOR vectors I'm going to use the Clifford algebra notation from videos 11 and 12 and denote basis vectors using the gamas and basis bi vectors using pairs of gamas the bi vectors that include one time Direction and one space Direction correspond to the electric field e since the electric field can linearly accelerate charged particles thereby giving it more energy and more momentum the B vectors made of two space directions correspond to the magnetic field B since they can cause a Charged particle to circle using centripetal acceleration which exchanges two of the momentum directions but doesn't change the energy but how does this fit in with the 1 comma 0 some 0 comma 1 lorence representation if you recall we previously used gamma 5 to separate a dra spinner into left and right halves the left half had an igen value of minus1 and the right half had an IG value of + one under gamma 5 we can do something similar by applying gamma 5 to the electromagnetic field remember squaring the gamas gives either + one or minus one and swapping the order of two different gamas gives us a minus sign in front if we apply gamma 5 to the gamma T gamma Zed by vector after swapping and Computing the squares we get I gamma X gamma Y which is another B Vector so gamma 5 has the effect of turning bi vectors into other bi vectors here's the action of gamma 5 on all the B vectors using these rules we can build these three linear combinations of basis by vectors when gamma 5 acts on these it Returns the Same by vectors but with a negative - one in front in other words these are igen B vectors of gamma 5 with igen values of -1 now if we take these three B vectors and reflect the spatial directions so that gamma's x y and Zed become negative we get another set of three B vectors when we act on these B vectors with gamma 5 we get ion values of + one instead sometimes you'll see these B vectors mul multiplied by an overall factor of -1 but this doesn't change their igen values they still span the same + one igen space so we've divided the six-dimensional space of SpaceTime by vectors into a pair of threedimensional subspaces the minus one and + one igen spaces under gamma 5 and we get from one Subspace to the other by mirroring the spatial Dimensions XY Z we can also use the left and right projectors we defined previously to split the electromagnetic field tensor into left and right halves it turns out that these minus1 and + one igen spaces transform independently under Lorent transformations to prove this we just need to show that the plus one and minus1 igen values are unchanged when we do a loren transformation let's take a by Vector Alpha with igen value + one from video 12 on spin groups we know that we can lorence transform this by Vector using a double-sided exponential note that because we're in space time the left exponential has a plus sign and the right exponential has a minus sign recall that we can expand this exponential using Oilers formula to give a scalar cosine term and a bi Vector sign term and we use hyperbolic trig functions if we're doing a boost now we want to apply gamma 5 to this Lorent transformed version of Alpha and show that the igen value has not changed this is easy to do because gamma 5 commutes with all B vectors in space time so we can slide gamma 5 past the exponential have it act on Alpha to give + one then bring the plus one back out in front so the Lorent transformed version of alpha retains the same igen value of + one a similar proof can be shown for a by Vector beta that has an igen value of minus1 so the + one and minus1 IG spaces are indeed invariant under lorence Transformations the B vectors with I value minus one are called anti-self dual by vectors these transform with the 1 comma 0 lorence representation and correspond to left circularly polarized electromagnetic waves the bi vectors with igen value + one are called self-dual by vectors these transform with the 0 comma 1 Lorent representation and they correspond to right circularly polarized electromagnetic waves so we can take our electromagnetic Faraday tensor and perform this change of basis to the igen by Vector basis the components of f in the new bi Vector basis become complex linear combinations of the E and B fields as we showed each of these two igen spaces transforms independently under Lorent Transformations so we can transform this six component column using a 6x6 Matrix which is broken into 3x3 block diagonal sections these 3x3 blocks are the 1 comma 0 and 0 comma 1 Lorent representation as an aside this form of the electromagnetic field is called the remon Silverstein Vector we can identify these two igen spaces with left and right circularly polarized electromagnetic waves the cross product of the E and B fields will always give the direction of electromagnetic wave propagation so we can Define left circular waves as having the B field leg behind the E field by a quarter phase with negative I and right circular waves will have the B field lead the E field by a quarter phase with plus I looking back at our six component column in the left circular case only the top half is nonzero and for the right circular case only the bottom half is non zero so these really do represent the left and right circular polarizations of the electromagnetic field you can pause if you want to look at the details but this is how the anti- selfdual B vectors rotate this is how they boost and here's how the formulas line up with the representation matrices it's also worth noting that the way we mixed the E and B fields to get a nice splitting into two parts is exactly the same mixing of the rotation and boost generators in the lorence algebra that we did to split the lorence algebra into two pieces and the selfdual and anti-self-dual basis vectors we defined are algebraically equivalent to the A's and B's and as another aside the concept of self-dual and anti-self-dual by vectors is usually defined using the Hodge star operator in differential geometry however in SpaceTime the hodg star gives imaginary igen values whereas gamma 5 gives real igen values so I used gamma 5 in this video to get real igen values finally we'll look at the m = 3 Nal 3 representation in terms of spins this is the 1 comma 1 representation getting the generators involves the tensor product of a pair of 3x3 matrices so we'll end up with 9 by9 matrices this is related to transforming rank two tensors in space time we're going to focus on covariant rank two SpaceTime tensors which have two lower indices these take two vectors as input and produce a scalar in Array notation the rank two tensor m is a 4x4 Matrix and the input vectors V transpose and W are sandwiched on either side now if we Loren transform the vectors with a lorence matrix Lambda inverse then to ensure we get the same scalar result in the new reference frame M must transform with Lambda transpose and Lambda on either side M has 16 components so it transforms under a 16 dimensional representation of the lorence group this means we could choose to write M as a 16 component column and write the tensor product of lambdas as a 16x16 transformation matrix now we can Define the symmetric part of M as a Matrix S which equals m + m transpose ID 2 and we can Define the anti- symmetric part of M as M minus M transpose / 2 s is symmetric so s transpose equals s and a is anti-symmetric so a transpose equals a and if we add s and a back together we get M back if we lorence transform the symmetric part s the result is also symmetric and if we Loren transform the anti-symmetric part A the result is also anti-symmetric so when we have a covariant Rank 2 tensor in SpaceTime the 10 symmetric components and the six anti- symmetric components transform independently from each other so the 16 dimensional repr representation decomposes into the direct sum of 10 and six dimensional representations now the 10-dimensional symmetric representation can be decomposed further because the trace of a rank two tensor is invariant in all coordinate systems now we have to be careful here if we take the Matrix for our rank two covariant tensor M the sum of the diagonal elements is not invariant under a transformation instead we need to raise an index using the inverse metric tensor G we're taking the metric G to be a covariant rank two tensor so it lorence transforms like this we're also assuming it's invariant under Loren Transformations so g equals the Loren transformed version of G and that leads to this property after we apply G inverse to M this raises an index and we get a one contravariant one covariant version of M now when we sum the diagonal elements we get the invariant trace of M this version of M transforms with Lambda inverse on the left instead of Lambda transpose and this is what makes the trace invariant under Loren Transformations I'm going to define the Matrix T to be the identity Matrix times the trace of M over four basically the four diagonal elements each hold a quarter of the trace of M and so they sum gives the trace of M so the trace of T equals the trace of M since both the trace and the identity Matrix are unchanged by Loren Transformations this T Matrix is also unchanged by Loren Transformations and so T acts like a scaler we can get the CO variant version of T by applying the metric G to it to lower one of its indices using the properties of the metric we now see this new GT Matrix is invariant under Lorent Transformations for covariant Rank 2 matrixes so this GT Matrix behaves like a scaler so the 10-dimensional symmetric representation s further breaks down into a one-dimensional trace part given by GT and a nine-dimensional symmetric traceless part given by S minus GT the nine-dimensional part is the EP transformed by the 1 comma 1 irreducible Lorent representation so to sum up a Rank 2 covariant tensor M has 16 components this breaks up into the direct sum of several sub representations the nine component symmetric traceless part the six component and anti symmetric part and the one component Trace part rank two tensors can be thought of as tensor products of pairs of rank one vectors so in SpaceTime M lives in the representation space of the tensor product of two 1 12 comma 1/2 EPS which are the vector EPS this decomposes into the direct sum of several ARS the one component Trace part is the 0 comma 0 scalar ER the nine component traceless symmetric part is the 1 comma 1 a and the six component anti-symmetric part is given by the 1 comma 0 su0 comma 1 representation which is exactly what we saw for the electromagnetic tensor which is also an anti-symmetric rank two tensor in SpaceTime so to sum up this video we learned that if we took the six generators of the SL2 C Le algebra and changed basis to the A's and B's using complex coefficients we could decompose the complexified SL2 C Le algebra into two copies of the complexified su2 algebras and this means elements of the SL2 C Le group can be decomposed into pairs of elements from the complexified su2 Le groups so to understand and the irreducible representations of the SL2 C Le group and Lee algebra we just need to pick two irreducible representations of the su2 Le group and Lee algebra and take their tensor product the two irreducible su2 representations can either be identified by their Dimensions M and N or their spin values J left and J right by picking different values for the spin number numbers we can write out all the irreducible representations of SL2 C using a two-dimensional table EPS in the First Column are called Left representations and EPS in the first row are called right representations we can flip back and forth between left and right representations just by reversing the spatial XY Z directions using minus signs we can also identify left and right representations using the igen values of the gamma 5 operator and project out left and right sub representations using the left and right projectors
