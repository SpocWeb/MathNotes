we're continuing our discussion of how Spinners are related to Le groups and Lee algebras in the last video we discussed how Le groups are continuous groups such as the group of rotations in 3D space called SO3 with capital letters we also found we could write the three basic rotation matrices as exponentials of special 3x3 matrices called generator matrices which live in the Lee algebra so 3 written with lowercase letters in a fractor font the Le group SO3 is made of 3x3 matricies where the inverse equals the transpose and the determinant is one we found that this group's generators in the Lee algebra SO3 were traceless anti-symmetric matrices and they obeyed these commutation relations here in the context of Lee algebras the commutator operation is also called the Lee bracket we said these matrices belonged to the spin one representation of the Le group SO3 and Lee algebra SO3 because these matrices are used to transform vectors which are rank one tensors in this video I'm going to introduce the spin zero representation which transforms scalers and the spin 1/2 representation which transforms Spinners this will lead us to talking about the double cover of SO3 which is su2 also called spin 3 in the last video I mentioned how the complex number I can be represented as a 2x2 matrix that squares to the negative identity Matrix in this way all operations with complex numbers can be written in the form of 2x2 matrices however there are many different matrices of all different sizes that also behave like the complex number I and square to the negative identity Matrix we call these different matrices different representations of I similarly the Lee algebra SO3 is defined by the following commutation relations between the three basis generators we've already found one set of 3x3 matrices that satisfy these relations but we can also look for matrices of other sizes which also satisfy them the simplest solution we could look for would be the case of 1x one matrices which is the spin zero representation one by one matrices are just scalers with square brackets written around them since scalers commute with each other the commutation relations automatically go to zero so we're forced to set all three of the generators to be the 1 by one zero Matrix if we exponentiate these one by one generator matrices exponentiate iting to the power of zero just gives the number one so our rotation matrices are just the one by one identity matrices containing a single number one inside so we find that the spin zero representation of the SO3 Le algebra is just one by one matrices containing the number zero and when we exponentiate these we get the spin zero representation of the SO3 Le Group which are just one by one matrices containing the number one we call this the spin zero representation because it tells us how to rotate spin zero particles which are represented by scalers this representation tells us that when we rotate a spin zero particle this is the same thing as multiplying it by the number one in other words spin zero particles represented by scalers do not change when we rotate them the higs boson and P mesons are examples of spin zero particles the spin zero representation is a bit boring and for this reason we call it the trivial representation of SO3 but it's an important fact to know that spin zero particles are unaffected by physical rotations so for the SO3 Le group we know the spin one representation which are 3x3 matrices and the spin zero representation which are one by one matrices but what about the spin 1/2 representation which would be 2x two matrices it turns out that there is no non-trivial 2x two representation of the SO3 Le group the proof of this is a little complicated and it will have to wait until the next video but we cannot find 2x two matrices that behave like the SO3 rotation group so how are we supposed to understand spin 1/2 particles that are represented by spinners if we don't have 2X two matrices that transform them it turns out we're going to need to go on a dour and instead of talking about the Le group SO3 we're going to talk about the Le group su2 the set of 2x2 matrices that are unitary meaning the inverse equals the hermiss conjugate denoted with a dagger and special meaning the determinant is one in video number 10 of this series I talked about how su2 matrices are the double cover of SO3 matrices when rotating a 3D Vector we normally use a 3X3 SO3 Matrix but we can also rewrite this 3D Vector as a 2x2 complex Matrix called a POI vector and rotate it using a double-sided transformation with a pair of su2 matrices that use half angles so to transform a PO vector v with an su2 Matrix U the transformation law is UV U dagger however if we replace U with minus U the two minus signs cancel out and we end up with the same transformation as plus u this means that both plus u and minus U perform the same rotation so for every SO3 rotation Matrix R there are two su2 matrices plus u and minus U that perform the same rotation this is why we say su2 matrices are the double cover of s SO3 in video number 12 we saw that su2 was equivalent to the spin 3 group from Clifford algebras in video number 10 we also showed that su2 is shaped like the three sphere with plus u and minus U located at opposite ends if we draw a projection line through plus u and minus U that projects them to the same point the result is the SO3 Group which is shaped like half of a three spere where if you wander off the edge you're immediately taken to the other side so to explore the su2 Le group let's look at the corresponding su2 Lee algebra this ends up being the set of traceless anti-h hermiss matrices the proofs for this are almost identical to the ones we saw for SO3 in the previous video we used this theorem for for a matrix a which says that the determinant of e to the a equals e to the trace of a since the determinant of an su2 Le group Matrix is one this automatically implies that the trace of its generator Matrix must be zero also the unitary property means U * U dger equals the identity Matrix if we take the derivative of both sides product rule gives us a sum of two terms equaling zero after a little algebra and setting Theta to zero we get that the su2 generator matrices must be anti-mission meaning M dagger equals m so let's see what traceless anti-mission matrices look like if we start with a general 2x2 matrix with complex numbers Alpha Beta Gamma Delta the traceless property means that Delta must equal negative Alpha the anti-mission property means the Herm Mission conjugate version of this Matrix equals its negative this means that Alpha complex conjugate equals negative Alpha so Alpha is a pure imaginary number with no real part also gamma equals negative beta complex conjugate so given this su2 generator Matrix we have a purely imaginary complex number Alpha and a complex number beta this translates to three real parameters a b and c C this means that all 2x2 traceless anti-mission matrices can be written as a linear combination of these three basis matrices if you've been watching all of this video series so far you might recognize these as the bi Vector matrices in the Clifford algebra cl3 recall that the Clifford algebra cl3 has a scaler represented by the identity Matrix three vectors represented by the PO or Sigma matrices and three B vectors and a tri Vector represented by the corresponding Matrix multiplications the 2x2 su2 generator matrices which are traceless and anti- hermiss are exactly the bi vectors in this Clifford algebra remember the Key properties of this Clifford algebra are that the basis vectors Square to the scalar one and orthogonal basis vectors anti commute so we can switch their order and get a negative sign so let's take the 2x2 generators of su2 to be the three B vectors from cl3 the subscripts on the generator correspond to the subscripts of the two sigmas that it is equal to now let's look at the commutator between gxy and gy Z if we sub in the corresponding sigmas we can swap these two Sigma pairs here in exchange for two minus signs which then cancel with each other then Sigma y^ 2 goes to 1 here and here then we swap the order of Sigma X and sigma Zed to get a negative sign and we end up with NE -2 * Sigma Z Sigma X which is -2 * the Z x generator so using this choice of su2 generators we get these commutation relations these factors of -2 are not desirable but we can easily remove them with a simple change of basis we'll Define the G Tilda basis as the G's * - one2 remember Lee algebra generators are like basis vectors so we're just reversing the vector directions and making them half as long with these extra factors of - one2 the commutator of any two generators is exactly equal to the Third generator so with this new basis we're able to remove the factors of -2 in the commutation relations and I'm just going to use this basis for our su2 generators from now on written without the tildas these three generators end up being equivalent to the unit querian J JK divided by two I showed the equivalence of the querian and bi vectors in video 6.1 they all obey the the same multiplication rules now you'll notice that these su2 Lee algebra commutation relations are exactly equal to the SO3 Le algebra commutation relations so what's going on here the two Lee algebras are equivalent even though their corresponding Lee groups are not equivalent remember su2 is the double cover of s SO3 so they are not equivalent I'll come back to to why this is later so we have this set of 2x2 matrices that satisfy our su2 Lee algebra commutation relations but now we'd like to see the actual su2 lead group members that do the rotations to see these Le group matrices we just exponentiate the generators let's compute the exponentiation of the XY generator times an angle Theta and see what we get now one option would be to use the tailor series definition of the Matrix exponential and plug in all the Matrix powers and end up with this Matrix as a result this is correct but it's a lot of work it turns out that there's an easier way recall Oiler formula which says that e to the I Theta equal cosine Theta + I sin Theta this can be proven using the tailor series of e s and cosine and it works because the symbol I squares to1 now the B Vector Sigma X Sigma y also squares to1 this is easily shown using the properties of the sigmas in Matrix form it squares to the negative of the 2x2 identity Matrix which I'm writing as this fancy number one because of this we can also use Oilers formula to rewrite its exponential so if we exponentiate Theta times the generator G gxy we can move the factor of -2 so that it's part of the angle using Oilers formula we get cosine of theta / 2 plus the XY by Vector * sin of theta / 2 we also put an identity Matrix in front of the cosine since we're dealing with 2x two matrices now cosine is symmetric so we can forget about the negative sign in its input and s is anti- symmetric so we can move its negative sign out in front so given this Oiler formula we can sub in the matricies combine the cosiness and SS into exponentials using Oilers formula in reverse and get this Matrix this is the su2 Matrix that rotates a spinner in the XY plane we can get the y z and ZX rotation matrices using similar Oiler style formulas the only difference is the choice of B Vector in front of the sign term these are the three su2 rotation matrices for po Spinners in three dimensions as an exercise you can show that any Matrix of this form is unitary so its inverse equals its Herm Mission conjugate as a hint you can remember that the Herm Mission conjugate of a b Vector just swaps the order of the sigmas so to sum everything up for the 2x2 represent ation of the su2 Lee algebra we can either view the generators as matrices as Clifford algebra by vectors or as unit querian and we can exponentiate these to get su2 Le group members which we can view as matrices Clifford elements from the spin 3 group or as querian so something worth noting here is that our SO3 rotation matrices on vectors rotate using using angles of theta but the corresponding su2 matrices rotate with angles of theta / 2 the factor of 1/2 comes from the 1/2 in the su2 Lee algebra generators we needed this factor of 1/2 to make sure the S SO3 and su2 Lee algebra commutation relations were the same in the case of SO3 rotation matrices if we rotate by an angle of 2 pi we just get the identity Matrix this means that if we rotate a vector by 2 pi the vector doesn't change which is what we expect now if we take our su2 rotation matrices and rotate by an angle of 2 pi we actually get Negative identity matrices so if we rotate a poy Spinner by 2 pi we get the negative version of that spinner it takes a rotation angle of theta equal 4 pi to get Iden matrices so Spinners require a rotation of 4 pi to come back to their original position the reason for this is that the su2 Le group is the double cover of the SO3 Le group remember su2 is shaped like a three-dimensional sphere with matrices plus u and minus U located at opposite sides rotating by an angle of 2 pi takes us from plus u to minus U U another Rotation by 2 pi takes us from minus U Back to plus u completing a full rotation however to get S SO3 we draw a line through plus u and minus U and project them to the same point which is a rotation Matrix R in SO3 rotations in SO3 cannot tell the difference between plus u and minus U and as a result s SO3 is shaped like half of a three sphere where wandering off the edge immediately teleports you to the opposite Edge as a result a rotation of 2 pi will bring you back to where you started so in SO3 we only need a rotation of 2 pi to do a complete rotation so to sum up this video so far we saw that the 3D rotation group SO3 has no 2x two representation or spin 1/2 presentation we needed to look at its double cover su2 which had the same Lee algebra to find the spin one half representation that rotates Spinners now let's go through a similar procedure for the lorence group s so +13 which is the set of rotations and lorence boosts in four-dimensional SpaceTime which also excludes Reflections in time and space recall the lorence group keeps the SpaceTime inter interval with one plus sign and three minus signs unchanged the inner product of a pair of space-time vectors requires this Matrix called demon kovsky metric with one plus sign and three minus signs along the diagonal this is usually denoted by the Greek letter Ada if we change coordinates using a 4x4 Lorent transformation matrix Capital Lambda the vectors will each transform with Lambda inverse which means the menovsky metric must transform with a pair of lambdas to balance out the change and keep the SpaceTime interval formula in variant so Lorent Transformations Capital Lambda are defined by Lambda transpose a to Lambda equaling Ada so the standard representation of the S plus 13 Le group is the set of 4x4 real matrices that leave the in kovsky metric invariant have determinant one and whose upper left Matrix entry is greater than zero we find the generators of rotations are traceless and anti-symmetric and the generators of boosts are traceless and symmetric there are six basic Lorent matrices in 4D space time three rotations which exchange two space dimensions and three boosts which exchange one space and one time Dimension I'm writing the boosts with these minus signs since boosting your frame in the plus X direction will cause vectors around you to have their X components become more negative I neglected to include this minus sign in some of my previous videos in video number nine of this series we found we could also write a 4D SpaceTime Vector as a 2X two complex Matrix that I decided to call a vile Vector this is Lorent transformed by a double-sided transformation using SL2 C matrices which are the 2x2 complex matrices with determinant one for every s so+ 13 Matrix there are two SL2 C matrices plus L and minus L that do the same lorence transformation so SL2 C is the double cover of s so plus 13 now what do the generators in the Lee algebra SL2 look like since SL2 C Le group matrices have a determinant of one we can use this theorem with Matrix exponentials to immediately conclude the generators are traceless now because su2 Le group matrixes were unitary their generators ended up being anti-mission but SL2 C leue group matrices are not required to be unitary so there is no requirement that their generators are anti Herm Mission looking at a general 2x2 complex Matrix if we force it to be traceless this means Delta equal Alpha this leaves us with three free complex parameters or six real parameters these correspond to the three B vectors and the three vectors in the Clifford algebra cl3 these six matrices form a basis for all 2x two traceless complex matrices the B vectors which are anti- hermiss generate the three rotations and the vectors which are Herm Mission generate the three boosts as a reminder these are the commutation relations for the S so +13 Lee algebra these should be the same commutation relations for the SL2 C Le algebra we saw earlier in this video that the rotation generators needed a factor of - 1/2 in front of the B vectors to make these commutation relations work out for the Boost generators we must also put - 1/2 in front of the vectors to satisfy the commutation relations you can pause if you want to see the proofs that these commutations work out or try to work them out yourself this is the JJ commutator the KK commutator the first set of JK commutators and the second in set of JK commutators now we've already seen that when we exponentiate the bi Vector generators we get 2x two rotation matrices that rotate Spinners and now when we exponentiate the vector generators we get 2x two boost matrices that transform Spinners notice that these boost matrices use hyperbolic trig functions this is because the Clifford algebra vectors Square to + one instead of minus1 and so the Oilers formula tailor Series has a bunch of plus signs which give us hyperbolic trig functions instead of circular TRG functions since the formulas for rotation matrices involve by vectors taking their hermiss conjugate flips the bi Vector order and gives the inverse so the rotation matrices are unitary since the Boost formulas involve only vectors which are hermiss all the Boost matrices are also her Mission so the generators of the Lee algebra SL2 C can be interpreted as matrices as bi vectors and vectors from the Clifford algebra cl3 and also as by vectors from the SpaceTime algebra cl13 if we use this mapping here between the sigmas and the gamas these bi vectors in cl13 can be thought of as the equivalent of querian but for four-dimensional SpaceTime we can also interpret the SL2 C lead group members in these three ways as well either as SL2 C matrices as members of the cl3 Clifford algebra or as members of the spin 13 group in the Clifford Algebra cl13 I talked about spin groups in video 12 in this series so we've discovered the spin 1/2 representation for 3D rotations which is su2 matrices and the spin 1/2 representation for 4D lorence Transformations which is SL2 C matrices there are some key differences between su2 and SL2 C that I'd like to explore one big difference is that su2 only has a single non-trivial 2x2 matrix representation but SL2 C has two non-equivalent non-trivial 2x2 matrix representations which are called the left and right representations to understand why SpaceTime has both left and right spin 1/2 representations we need to do a parody transformation I talked a little bit about this in video 9 a parody transformation is when we send all spatial directions to their negative version so it's a bit like reflecting the universe in a three-dimensional mirror let's see what happens to the 2x2 XY rotation Matrix under a parity transformation a parody transformation causes both X and Y vectors to get Negative signs which cancel with each other in the XY by Vector so the XY rotation Matrix and rotation matrices in general are unchanged under a parody transformation this is also true for the su2 generators this makes sense because rotating X into Y is equivalent to rotating X into y now let's do a parody transformation on a Boost since the Boost formula only involves a single Vector it does result in a sign change we can move this sign change into the hyperbolic sign since it's anti-symmetric and we can introduce a negative sign into hyperbolic cosine for free since it's symmetric we now see that a parody transformation on a Boost results in a boost with the negative hyperbolic angle in other words this is a boost in the opposite direction the Boost generators also change sign under a parody transformation this makes sense since if we have a boost in the plus X Direction reflecting the universe in a mirror will make it look like the Boost is in the minus X Direction instead so we see there are two spin 1/2 representations of SL2 C the original which I'll call the left chyal representation written 1 12 comma 0 and the version where the boosts are reversed which I'll call the right kyal representation written 0 comma 1/2 although some sources use the opposite naming convention exponentiating these SL2 C generators gives us left chyu and right chyal SL2 C Le group matrices we can swap between the left chyro and right chyal SL2 C matrices by taking the Herm Mission conjugate and then the inverse for rotations the SL2 C matrices are unitary and so Herm Mission conjugates and inverses are the same thing so the left and right versions of the matrices are equal for boosts the SL2 C matrices are permission so the dagger does nothing and so the left and right versions of the Boost matrices are inverses of each other these two representations are not equivalent because we cannot swap between them using a change of spinner basis I proved this in video 9 which is linked in the description we can take a left chyro vial spinner and a right chyro vial spinner and take their direct sum which means stacking the two spinners on top of each other the direct sum of their left and right SL 2C transformation matrices would be a combined 4x4 Matrix in Block diagonal form so that the left Matrix transforms the left spinner and the right Matrix transforms the right spinner this is a new represent resentation which is the direct sum of the left and right representations the 4x1 column spinner is called a direct spinner we can split up a direct spinner into the individual vial Spinners using these projection matrices here these can be written in abstract form using the direct matrices written in the chyal basis where this term here is often written as gamma 5 for short the next difference between su2 and SL2 C involves the tensor product of their representations I've shown in previous videos that the tensor product of two po Spinners can give us a 2X two po vector and the tensor product of two vial Spinners can give us a 2x2 vile Vector I'm going to take this vial vector and separate out the time component which is just a scale identity Matrix this is separated from the 3D spatial po Vector which I'm writing as V now let's do a rotation on this vile Vector using a pair of unitary su2 matrices after breaking up W into time and space parts and distributing we can move U past the identity Matrix and cancel it with UD dagger since for unitary matrices UD dagger equals U inverse the result here is that the spatial XY Z components of the vector transform under a 3D rotation with su2 matrices and the time component of the vector doesn't transform at all so it behaves like a scaler now let's try this again but this time doing a general lent transformation with a general SL2 C Matrix L we can move L past the identity Matrix again but it does not cancel with l dagger since in general SL2 C matrices are not guaranteed to be unitary this basically means that the time component doesn't neatly separate out from the space components since a boost can potentially cause time and space to mix with each other this means that a Lorent transformation does not always cleanly separate into a 3D vector rotation and a scalar component that does not change we must treat the 4D SpaceTime Vector as one object since the tensor product of a left and right vial spinner gives a 4D SpaceTime vector and each spinner transforms with its own SL2 C Matrix we can think of 4D SpaceTime vectors as transforming with the tensor product of a left SL2 C Matrix and a right SL2 C Matrix if we Loren transform a vile Vector to a new frame and Carry Out The Matrix multiplications we can set the Matrix components equal to each other to get four equations which can then be Rewritten using a 4x4 Matrix this 4x4 Matrix can then be Rewritten again as the tensor product of a left SL2 C Matrix and the inverse of a right SL2 C Matrix now the entries of a vile Vector Matrix involve the sums and differences of SpaceTime coordinates but we can easily change coordinates to The Standard Time XY Z coordinates using these formulas which translate to this Matrix and its inverse putting all this together we can see this gives a 4x4 s so +13 Matrix that lorence transforms a 4D SpaceTime vector and this s +13 Matrix is ultimately just the tensor product of left and right SL two c matrices along with a change of basis this representation of the lorence group is denoted like this or just as 1/ 12 comma 1 12 so in SpaceTime the vector representation is really just the tensor product of two spinner representations so even though a direct spinner and a 4D SpaceTime Vector both have four components direct Spinners transform with the direct sum of the left and right spin 1/ half representations and SpaceTime vectors transform with the tensor product of the left and right spin 1/ half representations the last thing I'll talk about in this video is how the su2 and SL2 C Le algebras are connected by complex numbers when looking at the 2x2 representation of the SL2 C Le algebra the three rotation generators are anti-mission and square to1 and they form the Lee algebra su2 however if we multiply them by netive I we get the three boost generators which are Herm Mission and square 2 + 1 so we can think of the six generators of SL2 c as being made of two copies of su2 combined using the direct sum one ordinary copy of su2 for the rotation generators and another copy of su2 multiplied by plus or minus the complex I to get boosts the plus or minus sign determines whether we get the left or right spin 1/2 representation we call this the complexified version of su2 so with the ordinary su2 Lee algebra we combine the generators using real scaling coefficients but with the complexified version of su2 denoted with this C subscript we can scale the generators by complex scaling coefficients since SL2 C is the direct sum of su2 and I * su2 we can complexify both sides and see that the complexification of SL2 C is equivalent to two complexified copies of su2 we can absorb the complex I inside the second su2 since it's complexified anyway so complex coefficients are allowed this leads to an interesting trick with the generators we previously defined the SL2 C Le algebra in terms of rotation generators the J's and the Boost generators the K's in the commutation relations the J's and K's get mixed together now I'm going to define a change of basis to the generators that I'm calling A's and B's I'm going to rewrite the J generators using the axis they rotate around instead of the plane they rotate in and I'm going to drop the time T index from the K generators now I'm going to define the a generators as J + I k/ 2 and the B generators as J minus I k/ 2 where I've matched the indices of the J's and K's in each form if we write out the commutation relations in this new basis the A's and B's cleanly separate out into a pair of commutation relations where the commutators of the A's and B's with each other is zero these A and B commutation relations look exactly like the su2 commutation relations so in this way the SL2 C Le algebra is sort of like a pair of su2 Lee algebras since this change of generator basis involves scaling by the complex I this means SL2 C and both copies of su2 have been complexified so in this way the complexified SL2 C Le algebra is the direct sum of two complexified su2 Le algebras
