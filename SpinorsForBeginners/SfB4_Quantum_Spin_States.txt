in this video we're going to look at our second example of spinners in physics which involves the stair and gearlock experiment and how it reveals the existence of quantum spin States we're going to find that the mathematics used to describe Quantum spin States is the exact same as the mathematics used to describe the polarizations of classical light waves that we saw in the last two videos they are both described by two by one complex columns called Spinners that can be rotated with su2 matrices and there is an angle doubling relationship between physical space and the quantum State space just like how we saw there was an angle doubling relationship between polarization space and physical space in the last video before getting to the spinner mathematics let's describe the stair and gerlock experiment which was performed in 1922. I'm going to call it the SG experiment for short the SG experiment involves a beam of neutral atoms and an inhomogenous magnetic field a homogeneous magnetic field would have the same strength everywhere but this strangely shaped magnetic device is able to generate an inhomogenous magnetic field which is stronger at this pointed tip labeled South and weaker on the lower half labeled North the beam of neutral atoms in the original experiment was made of silver atoms neutral atoms have an equal number of protons and electrons so there is no net charge naively you'd expect neutral atoms to be completely unaffected by a magnetic field but the Bohr model of the atom that was developed in the early 1900s predicted that electrons orbited around the nucleus and this small Loop of electric current would behave like a magnetic dipole or a tiny bar magnet now if we were to send a bunch of tiny classical bar magnets through this inhomogenous magnetic field then the bar magnets with North pointing up would be deflected upward since the magnetic field is stronger at this tip and magnets with North pointing down would be deflected downward and every other orientation of bar magnet would be deflected somewhere in between depending on their orientation however after performing The Experiment this is not what we see we only see two types of deflection either completely up or completely down and nothing in between this experiment shows us that when we measure the angular momentum of a silver atom there are only two possible discrete results and so the angular momentum of silver atoms is quantized in later years this magnet-like behavior of silver atoms was found to be not due to the electrons orbital angular momentum around the nucleus it was later discovered that the Bohr model was wrong and that electron orbitals come in various shapes the first 46 electrons in a silver atom have no net orbital angular momentum overall the final 47th electron exists in the spherical 5S orbital which also has no net orbital angular momentum so electron orbitals do not generate a magnetic field here instead the magnetic dipole in silver atoms is due to the 47th electrons internal angular momentum also called spin angular momentum this internal angular momentum is sometimes envisioned as being due to the electron spinning on an axis like a ball however in reality electrons are described by wave functions and are not tiny spinning balls so this explanation also fails to explain the magnetic dipole the concept of an electron having internal angular momentum has a reputation for being very difficult to understand however there's an analogy with light that can help our understanding here matter particles have orbital angular momentum when they actually curve around in space and light rays can also have orbital angular momentum when they curve around in space but from our last video we know that light waves can be polarized which allows for an internal type of angular momentum that is internal to the light beam itself modern Quantum field Theory tells us that matter particles can also have something similar to a polarization which gives them internal angular momentum that's internal to the particles field instead of being due to curved paths in physical space but we're not going to focus on Quantum fields for now for this video we just want a basic experimental understanding of the quantized spin angular momentum of electrons we'll get this understanding by sending a beam of atoms through multiple SG experiments to start let's review some of the notation and Mathematics used in quantum mechanics In classical mechanics when we talk about the state of a particle we're referring to the particle's position and momentum and how these quantities change over time but in quantum mechanics a particle's state is instead represented by an abstract State Vector which Loosely speaking is the same thing as the particle's wave function everything that we can possibly know about a particle like its position momentum and energy can be derived from the particle's state vector this idea of an abstract State Vector can be a bit confusing but hopefully it will become more clear as the video goes on the standard way of writing a vector in physics is to write a little arrow above the variable but in quantum mechanics we use the KET Vector notation and write vectors like this with an angle bracket pointing to the right we can write cat factors as linear combinations of basis vectors as we normally do or write the components of the vector in a column like this four vectors with real components we can get the squared length of a vector v by writing V transpose V but in quantum mechanics Vector components can be complex numbers so we get the squared length of a vector by doing the transpose conjugate times V this extra complex conjugate ensures our final result for the magnitude is real the transpose complex conjugate is called the hermitian conjugate of a vector and this is written with a dagger symbol in quantum mechanics we write the hermitian conjugate of cat vectors like this with an angle bracket that's pointing left these are called bra vectors you can Loosely think of cat vectors as columns and Loosely think of bra vectors as rows when multiplied together they give a single number this is called their inner product now one of the strange Concepts in quantum mechanics is the idea of wave function collapse this is the idea that a particle can be in a superposition of several States but as soon as we measure the particle it will collapse into a single state According to some probabilistic rules mathematically Quantum superpositions are represented by linear combinations where each basis Vector represents one of the possible States the system can collapse to the coefficients in the linear combination are called probability amplitudes and they are related to the probability of measuring each state after the collapse in the SG experiment there are only two states the particle can collapse to either spin up denoted with an up Arrow cut or spin down denoted with a down arrow cut the rules for determining the probabilities for collapsing into a given state are given by Bourne's rule in simplified form Bourne's rule tells us that when we want to know the probability of some State a collapsing onto a state B after a measurement this probability equals the squared magnitude of the inner products of the states A and B written in brockette notation like this this inner product is sort of like the overlap between the two State vectors A and B if we were to cast A's Shadow onto B the process of casting B's Shadow onto a gives us the same result except complex conjugated however since the probabilities we measure are the squared lengths of these inner product overlaps it doesn't matter which direction we measure the overlaps in so the squared magnitude of these two inner products are equal now let's use born's rule to try and understand the quantum states in the SG experiment better we'll do this by putting particles through multiple SG experiments in a row to simplify the diagrams a bits I'm going to replace these magnets by a box with the letter Z on it this indicates the nhomogeneous magnetic field points in the Z Direction I'm also going to rewrite the spin up and spin down States AS Plus said and minus said indicating the coordinate directions that the particles are deflected in let's say that the particles in the initial beam are in some State PSI after going through the SG apparatus they collapse into one of two states either spin up or spin down let's take the spin up particles and put them through another SG apparatus we find that all the particles are deflected up and none are deflected down so according to Bourne's rule the probability of measuring spin up given a spin up state is one and the probability of measuring spin down given a spin up state is zero now let's put an SG apparatus after the down States as you might expect all the particles are deflected down so Bourne's rule tells us the probability of measuring spin down from spin down is one and the probability of measuring spin up from spin down is zero all of these inner product relationships from born's rule give us some useful information about the spin up and spin down state vectors for example it tells us that the spin Upstate has a magnitude of one and the spin down state also has a magnitude of one also the spin up and spin down states are orthogonal since their inner product is zero so in physical space up and down are separated by a turn of 180 degrees but in our Quantum State space where the particle spin States live the spin up and spin down states are orthogonal so they are 90 degrees apart so we're already starting to see that there's an angle doubling relationship between physical space and the quantum State space next we'll try the exact same setup except rotating the SG apparatuses by 90 degrees so that the magnetic fields are oriented in the direction of the x-axis so that particle beams are split into the plus X and minus X directions performing the exact same experiments as above we get born rule formulas for the plus X state and the minus X state these inner product formulas tell us that the plus X and minus X states have magnitudes of one and the plus X and minus X states are orthogonal now let's try something more interesting let's arrange the first SG apparatus so that it points in the X Direction and then send the plus X particle beam through a second SG apparatus pointing in the Z Direction we find that the plus X particle beam is split evenly in the plus set and minus Z directions taking borne's rule again the probability of measuring plus said from plus X is one-half and the probability of measuring minus said from plus X is also one half if we repeat the experiment but starting with the minus X beam instead we also find a 50 50 split between the plus set and minus Z States so the plus X and minus X states can each collapse into the plus set or minus Z States when a magnetic field in the Z direction is applied this is telling us that the plus X State can be written as a Quantum superposition of the plus Z and minus Z states with the proper coefficients because it can collapse into either one after a measurement and remember Quantum superposition is just a fancy way of saying linear combination in order to get the expected probabilities of one-half from the experiment we need to set the coefficients for plus X to be one over the square root of two and one over the square root of two you can check that applying a plus said bra Vector to a plus Z cat vector and then squaring the results gives us the expected probability of one-half the same goes for applying the negative Z state to the plus X state the minus X state uses the coefficients plus one over the square root of two and minus one over the square root of two this also reproduces the expected probabilities of one-half and importantly this choice of coefficients makes the plus X and minus X states orthogonal with an inner product of zero and also makes each have a magnitude of one as expected looking at our Quantum spin space the plus X and minus X States look like this this continues with the expected angle doubling relationship with physical space where a 45 degree turn in Quantum spin space is a 90 degree turn in physical space next let's look at a pair of SG experiments pointing along the y-axis looking at the born rules we see that the plus Y and minus y states have magnitudes of 1 and are orthogonal if we start with a y aligned SG apparatus and then feed the plus y particle beam into a z-aligned SG apparatus we once again find a 50 50 split between the plus Z and minus Z States the same occurs if we begin with the minus y particle beam so the plus Y and minus y States can be written as Quantum superpositions of plus said and minus said because they can collapse into either one but if we want to write the Y States as Quantum superpositions of the plus Z and minus Z States we run into a problem we've already used the coefficients of plus one over the square root of 2 and -1 over the square root of two for our spin plus X and minus X States and we can't reuse those coefficients so what coefficients can we pick that will still give us probabilities of 50 percent the secret is to start using complex numbers we'll write the plus y State as a superposition of plus Z and minus Z using the coefficients one over the square root of 2 and I over the square root of two if we calculate the inner product of the plus Z and plus y States and then find the squared magnitude we get the expected probability of one-half the same thing happens for the inner product of the minus Z and plus y States the imaginary I goes away when we take the squared amplitude for the minus y State we use coefficients of one over the square root of two and minus I over the square root of 2. this gives the expected probabilities of one-half this also ensures that the plus Y and minus y states are orthogonal with an inner product of zero and also ensures their magnitudes are one as an exercise you can check that the inner product of one of the X states with one of the Y States always gives a squared magnitude of one-half and you can also think about what this means in terms of the results of the corresponding SG experiments so if we look at all the quantum superposition formulas we've written so far these relationships exactly match the formulas for the Jones vectors we saw in the previous two videos we can flip back and forth between them using this dictionary it also turns out that we can arrange these six Quantum States on a sphere like this aligning them with the directions and physical space that they actually represent this sphere is called the block sphere this is mathematically equivalent to the point array sphere we saw in the last video where these six main polarizations of light are also arranged on a sphere with LightWave polarizations we could mix the polarizations together in various ways to get any polarization on this sphere including elliptical polarizations similarly we can mix the quantum States in various superpositions to give any state on this sphere these correspond to States associated with SG experiments that are aligned at arbitrary directions in space we showed in the last video that we could rotate vectors across these spheres using two by two unitary matrices written as U2 for short remember rotating a vector PSI with a matrix u means that it's squared magnitude won't change so the squared magnitude formula should be equal before and after the rotation we can show that these matrices must have the property that U inverse equals U dagger which is the definition of a unitary Matrix now it turns out that for rotating these Quantum states on the sphere U2 matrices are too General because we've missed an important fact about born's rule as we already know Bourne's rule tells us that the probability of measuring a state a collapsing into a state B is the squared magnitude of the inner product of A and B now let's modify the state a by giving it a complex phase Factor e to the I Theta if we now calculate the probability of our new a state collapsing into State B we get the squared magnitude of this inner product the phase e to the I Theta gets a negative sign due to the required hermitian conjugate since e to the I Theta is just a scalar number we can pull it outside of the inner product and here the magnitude of a product is the same thing as the product of the magnitudes and the magnitude of a complex phase e to the I Theta is just one because it lives on the complex unit circle so the probability formula we get is unchanged compared to before so we know that when we measure the state a it can collapse into various other states According to some known probabilities and we just learned that when we measure the state a multiplied by a phase Factor it can collapse into the exact same set of states with the exact same probabilities because the states A and A times phase collapse into the exact same states with the exact same probabilities practically speaking there is no difference between them in real quantum mechanics experiments all we can do is perform experiments over and over again and keep score of the results we get if one scientist did experiments with State a and another scientist did experiments with State a times phase they would find all the statistics of their experimental results are the exact same so physically speaking State a and state a times phase are actually the same physical state even if the vectors look different the two vectors give the exact same physics so in quantum mechanics a physical state is unchanged when we multiply its vector by an overall phase such as I negative 1 or any other complex phase now recall we said that U2 matrices will perform rotations on our block sphere of States but since overall phases don't matter there are multiple U2 matrices that can rotate us to the same output State each Matrix with a different overall phase so there is some redundancy in the group of U2 matrices in order to pick a unique U2 Matrix for doing rotations on our block sphere we pick the specific U2 Matrix whose determinant is one remember we can always set the determinant of a U2 Matrix to plus one by multiplying it by the correct complex phase this restricts us to su2 the group of two by two unitary matrices with determinants of plus one so in conclusion the behavior of quantum spin States is mathematically equivalent to the behavior of Jones vectors and light polarizations both are represented by two component complex columns which can be represented geometrically on a sphere we can rotate between points on the sphere using su2 matrices since both Quantum States and light polarizations don't care about overall phase factors which includes not caring about overall negative signs in the case of physical space for wave polarizations and the quantum State space for Quantum spin States these are spaces where the overall negative signs are still visible however when we move to the point array sphere and block sphere where the overall phases don't matter there is no difference between a vector's positive version and its negative version so one rotation in the original space corresponds to two rotations on these mathematical spheres where overall negative signs are ignored this is the source of the angle doubling relationships between the two spaces and why these two by one complex columns are called spinners now we've described the basic mathematics of spinners as two by one columns that rotate with su2 matrices and don't care about overall phase factors but it's possible you still find this pretty confusing so in our next video we're going to show how we can visualize Spinners as flag pulls on a sphere and show how these Spinners are really elements of a space called the complex projective line this will hopefully make all the mysterious mathematical properties of spinners disappear and make them seem more like common sense
