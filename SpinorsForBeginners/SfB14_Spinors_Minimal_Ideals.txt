in this video I'm finally going to give a definition of spinners using Clifford algebras Spinners are members of minimal left ideals in Clifford algebras this definition is a bit abstract but it works in any dimension for both space and SpaceTime we're going to see that the 2x1 column po Spinners we saw earlier in the series can be incorporated into Clifford algebras in the form of 2x two matrices where only the First Column is nonzero these special matrices belong to a minimal left ideal as we learned in the previous video These matrices form a left ideal because when a matrix is Multiplied onto them from the left the result retains the same form of only the First Column being nonzero po Spinners are rotated using single sided Transformations with half angle su2 matrices which is equivalent to the quatern I in Clifford algebras we write the spinner rotation using a 2x2 matrix acted on by a half angle member of the spin 3 Group which is equivalent to the su2 matrices this single-sided transformation is different than vectors which transform with double-sided Transformations with half angle su2 matrices or half angle members of the spin 3 group if any of that seemed confusing I'll explain it all step by step in this video let's start with a quick review of Clifford algebras and their Matrix representations the Clifford algebra clpq is given by P basis vectors that square to + 1 and Q basis vectors that square to minus one the basis vectors are orthogonal and so they anticommute with each other so we can swap their order in exchange for a negative sign for example cl30 has three basis vectors Sigma X Sigma Y and sigma Z that all square to + one and anti- commute with each other this may be more familiar in the Matrix representation which is given by the PO or Sigma matrices let's take a closer look at cl30 which is built from the three basic vectors Sigma X Sigma Y and sigma Z but the Clifford algebra cl30 itself is eight dimensional because it contains one scaler three vectors three bi vectors and one Tri Vector the bi vectors are sometimes called pseudo vectors because they can be thought of as a rotation about an axis the tri Vector is sometimes called the pseudo scaler and is often written as a capital I you can check for yourself that the tri Vector squares to -1 the tri Vector also commutes with everything in the cl30 algebra and so the order of multiplication with the tri Vector doesn't matter in this way the tri Vector in cl30 is sort of like the complex I which is normally written in lower case but since we're really talking about a tri Vector here we denote it with a capital i the bi vectors are sometimes written as a vector times the tri Vector like this this is their pseudo Vector form and it emphasizes that they can be thought of as a rotation about a particular axis we can represent all abstract symbols in cl30 as 2x two matrices the scaler one is the identity Matrix the vectors are given by the three po matrices and the rest can be computed by doing the standard Matrix multiplications the tri vector or pseudo scaler is just the identity Matrix times the complex I this gives us eight matrices in total by adding these eight matrices together in linear combination we can get any 2x2 matrix with any complex entries that we like by specifying these eight real coefficients now how do spinners fit in here the Spinners associated with 3D space are called po Spinners and as we've seen in previous videos they are written as 2x1 Columns of complex numbers according to the star Garlock experiment that deflects electrically neutral particles in a magnetic field according to their spin the top spinner component is associated with the spin Upstate plus Zed and the bottom spinner component is assoc associated with the spin down State minus Z but everything in the Clifford algebra cl30 is made of 2x two matrices so how can we fit our 2x1 po Spinners inside of our Clifford algebra the key to solving this problem is either very smart or very stupid depending on your point of view all we do is take our 2x1 po spinner and extend it with an extra column of zeros so so that it becomes a 2x2 matrix this is how we write poy Spinners inside the Clifford algebra cl30 so our spin up state would be this Matrix with a one in the upper left and our spin down state would be this Matrix with a one in the lower left but how do we build these matrices using the eight basis matrices in our Clifford algebra let's start with our plus Z spin up spinner just looking at the matrices it looks like if we add 1 and sigma Zed together we get the right answer if we divide by two the lower right values cancel and 1 + 1 becomes 2 and divided by two becomes one so this is our spin up spinner for our minus Z spin down spinner it looks like Sigma X and the sigma y pseudo Vector give us the right answer if we subtract them and divide by two indeed the upper right entries cancel and 1 + 1 divided two gives us one so this is our spin down spinner note that we can rewrite the sigma y pseudo Vector as the Z x by vector and then swap Sigma Zed and sigma x with a sign change then factor out Sigma X this gives us Sigma x * the spin spin up spinner and this is an alternative way of writing the spin down spinner so in quantum mechanics we normally write a spinner as a linear combination of the spin up and spin down basis Spinners using components Cai 1 and Cai 2 but now we replace these basis Spinners with these elements from our cliford algebra which correspond to these 2x two matrices here and if we rotate this spinner using a single-sided half angle su2 Matrix we get the same result we would expect from standard quantum mechanics just with an extra column of zeros added on in the language of Clifford algebras we replace the su2 Matrix with an equivalent spin 30 group member so now we can rotate Spinners in purely symbolic notation in our Clifford algebra as an exercise you can try checking that this symbolic Clifford algebra multiplication works out to the equivalent Matrix result now we were able to build these Spinners in the Clifford algebra cl30 by visual inspection we started with the Matrix representation for our Spinners then looked at the basis matrices available to us in the algebra and we were able to guess the correct matrices we needed to build the spinner if we forget about the matrices and just use the symbols we have an abstract version of our Spinners that behaves the exact same way this works fine in three dimensions but how can we make this procedure work in any Dimension the key is to realize that these special spinner matrices we used are members of minimal left ideals in Clifford algebras which is a definition we covered in the last video spin spinners for beginners number 13 if we add two spinner matrices together we get another spinner Matrix and if we multiply a spinner Matrix from the left by any 2x two Matrix we get another spinner Matrix these two properties are the definition of a left ideal we say it is a left ideal because the multiplication property only works if we multiply the 2x two matrices from the left if we multiply a 2X two Matrix from the right we don't get a spinner Matrix back so we see that Spinners are members of left ideals in Clifford algebras but what is a minimal left ideal we say an ideal set is minimal when there are no sub ideals inside of it ignoring the trivial ideal consisting of just the zero element I actually forgot to exclude the trivial zero ideal in my definition in the last video so keep in mind when I say minimal ideal I mean the ideal has no sub ideals inside of it except for the trivial zero ideal this property of being minimal doesn't come up with the 2x two matrices so let's look at 4x4 matrices instead the set of matrices here where the first pair of columns are non zero and the second pair of columns are zero is a left ideal in the set of 4x4 matrices however it's not a minimal left ideal there are actually smaller left ideal sets found inside it the set where only the First Column is nonzero and the set where only the second column is nonzero when we say Spinners are members of minimal left ideals in Clifford algebras we're basically saying that the Matrix representation of the spinner behaves like a matrix with a single nonzero column now I want to be clear that not all minimal left ideals look like matrices with single non-zero columns matrices that belong to minimal left ideals are not always obvious at first glance and we need to keep their formal definition in mind however for Simplicity we'll often use a matrix where only the leftmost column is nonzero because it's easier to understand this lets us take the column Spinners we've seen previously like Po Spinners vile Spinners and dra Spinners and write them using abstract symbols in Clifford algebras now we've seen how to build po Spinners by using Matrix representations first and then working backwards to the abstract Clifford algebra symbols but what if we want to build Spinners without the Matrix representations the key is to use the projectors we learned about in the last video remember a projector is an element P that squares to itself when a projector acts on an algebra the result of the projection is always un ideal for example when this projector Matrix pz plus has a 2X two Matrix multiplied onto it from the left the result is a member of a left ideal the same rule applies when we take an abstract projector made of symbols and apply our cliff algebra onto it from the left we learned in the last video that if we have a unit element U that squares 2 + 1 then the expression 12 * 1 + U is a projector because this expression squares to itself let's try making a projector made with Sigma Zed and seeing what happens when we multiply the algebra cl30 onto it from the left before we do I'll introduce one helpful Pro ejector property from this thesis by Crystal and McKenzie called the poman property this thesis has a lot of good information on building Spinners using minimal left ideals in Clifford algebras particularly in appendix B I've left a link to this thesis in the description in games like Pac-Man or Mrs Pac-Man the character is often seen eating up a line of pellets one by one until there are none left our projector pz plus behaves the same way if we multiply it onto Sigma Zed and then work out the multiplication the sigma Zed effectively disappears just like one of the pellets leaving us only with the projector pz plus so if we have the projector pz plus put in front of a long trail of Sigma Zs the projector can eat up the sigma Zeds one by one until they all disappear so we can get a pz plus projector to eat up a line of Sigma Zeds or use the property in Reverse to create a line of Sigma Zeds in front of the projector this property works on both the left and right sides of the projector with the poman property in mind let's take our eight basis elements from the Clifford algebra cl30 and multiply them onto our projector pz Plus multiplying the projector with one just gives us our projector back multiplying the projector with Sigma X we distribute and get this for convenience I'm going to rewrite this B Vector Sigma x * Sigma Z in its pseudo Vector form asga Sigma y * the pseudo scalar capital I multiplying the projector with Sigma Y and distributing I will again rewrite the by Vector Sigma y * Sigma Z in pseudo Vector form as Sigma x * I multiplying the projector with Sigma Zed just gives us the projector back by the poman property notice that this is the same result as just multiplying the projector with one with Sigma y Sigma Zed this actually gives us the same result as just Sigma y remember the poman property allows us to use this projector to eat up Sigma Zed and ignore it with Sigma Z * Sigma X we can swap the order and pick up a negative sign and ignoring Sigma Zed using the poman property we get the same result as Sigma X but with a minus sign in front multiplying with Sigma x * Sigma Y and distributing I can rewrite this B Vector as a pseudo vector and just rewrite the tri Vector as the pseudoscalar capital i multiplying with the tri Vector gives us the same result since we can just ignore the sigma Zed by the paman property so when we take the eight basis elements of cl30 and then put them through a projector with pz plus we only get four independent elements out on the other side in one case we get plus and minus versions of the same element but these are not independent since we can go from one to the other through scalar multiplication by -1 it makes sense that we turned eight elements into four elements because the projector operation essentially lets us forget about the sigma Zeds in our formulas so any basis elements that only differ by a factor of Sigma Zed get projected to the same result so these four elements form a basis of our minimal left ideal in cl30 I can re write these elements AS pz Plus Sigma X pz plus I Sigma X pz Plus and I pz plus if we write out the Matrix representations of these Spinners we find they correspond to the four different real numbers inside a 2x1 PO column spinner they are just written in abstract form instead we can alternatively think of this as two basis vectors with complex coefficients in front if we allow the pseudoscalar I to instead be represented by the complex I here pz plus represents the spin Upstate and sigma X pz Plus represents the spin down state now I would like to take this minimal left ideal definition of spinners and generalize it to any Dimension but first i'm going to spend a little more time thinking about Spinners in cl3 3 and make sure they're exactly the objects we want for quantum mechanics one thing to check is to make sure Spinners behave properly when we act on them with Quantum operators in the staran Garlock experiment there are two possible measurements spin up or spin down we denote these measurements by plus h/2 andus h/2 algebraically these are measured by applying the spin Z operator onto our spin States this operator equals h/2 * Sigma Z so let's see what happens when we take our spin States and operate on them with Sigma Zed if we apply Sigma Zed to our spin up State this is the same thing as applying Sigma Zed to our pz plus projector so it gets eaten up by the poman property giving back just our spin up state so the spin Zed up operator measures Plus h/2 on the spin up State as expected we can also apply Sigma Zed to our spin down state which we can write as Sigma x * P z+ swapping the two sigmas gives us a negative sign and the pz plus projector eats up the sigma Zed leaving us with the negative of our spin down state so the spin Zed operator measures minus h over2 on the spin down state as expected so we can see that our Clifford algebra Spinners obey the standard rules of quantum mechanics we can also build the plus x - X Plus Y and minus y States out of our plus Z and minus Z States and the corresponding operators behave as expected something else to consider are dual Spinners in quantum mechanics we often deal with spinners also called CET Spinners as well as dual Spinners also called bra Spinners put together a bra and K or bracket output a scalar complex number which is the probability amplitude of one state collapsing onto the other normally we think of bras as being the hermiss conjugate of kets denoted with a dagger in other words we take a KET column and transpose it into a row and take the complex conjugate of the entries if we take the hermiss conjugate of one of our 2x two spinner matrices where only the First Column is non zero we end up with a 2x2 matrix where only the first row is non zero this is a minimal right ideal of cl30 so Spinners live in minimal left ideals and dual Spinners live in minimal right ideals remember we get a left ideal by multiplying 2x two matrices onto our projector from the the left and we get a right ideal by multiplying 2x two matrices onto our projector from the right when using the abstract symbols of Clifford algebras the dagger operation no longer means Herm Mission conjugate instead it indicates the reversal operation so if we have a general multiv Vector M multiplied onto the projector from the left and we take the reverse of this we end up with the reverse of the projector times the reverse of the multiv vector and since our projector is only made up of a scaler plus a vector the reverse operation does nothing to it so essentially the reverse operator switches us from a left ideal to a right ideal in other words the reverse operator changes a spinner into a dual spinner so if we take a spinner Cai written as a linear combination of spin up and spin down States and then take its reverse reverse this applies the reverse to the components and the basis Spinners and exchanges their order the reverse also changes the basis Spinners into dual basis Spinners it's also worth noting that our spinner components are actually a sum of a scaler and a tri vector or pseudo scaler when we take the reverse of this the scaler one is unchanged but the Reversed pseudo scaler gets an extra minus sign so so here the reverse operator is playing a role similar to The Complex conjugate also recall that both scalers and sud sudo scalers commute with everything in the algebra so we can move them to the left or right of basis spinners for free now let's try performing the inner product between a bra and a KET if we do this using our 2x two matrices we unfortunately don't get a scaler we get the inner product result in the top left entry of the The Matrix but a true scaler in a Clifford algebra would be this number multiplied by the scaler one which is the identity Matrix how can we fix this we get around this problem by using something called the grade projection operator denoted with angle brackets and a subscript K this operator takes a multiv vector as input and outputs the Ki grade elements inside the multiv vector for example given a multiv Vector M the grade zero projection gives us the scalar part the grade 1 projection gives us the vector part the grade two projection gives us the bi Vector part and the grade three projection gives us the tri Vector part the result of our dual spinner acting on a spinner is this expression times our pz plus operator which has a scalar part plus a vector part to get the scalar part on its own all we do is use the grade projection operator and then we multiply by two to get rid of the factor of 1/2 note that many sources will omit the zero subscript in the special case of a grade zero projection as a convention in their notation so in cl30 we calculate the inner product of two spinners Zeta and Cai by taking the Clifford product of Zeta reverse and Kai and projecting out the scalar part and multiplying by two here the kai acts like a cat spinner from a minimal left ideal and The Zeta reverse acts like a bra spinner or dual spinner from a minimal right ideal another thing to check is to make sure that a spinner and a dual spinner multiply together in the other direction to give a vector in previous videos I talked about how Spinners are sort of like the square roots of vectors because we can factor a POI vector into a spinner times a dual spinner we should also check that we can multiply a spinner and dual spinner into a vector in Clifford algebras note that the cat spinner has components Cai 1 and Cai 2 and the bra dual spinner has components negative 2 and Cai 1 we can write out these Spinners as linear combinations of our plus Z and minus Z basis Spinners we can then rewrite the plus Z spinner as our pz plus projector and rewrite the minus Z spinner as Sigma x * P z+ we can factor out pz Plus on the right of the first term and factor out pz plus from the left side of the second term because pz plus is a projector its square equals itself we can now rewrite pz plus as 1 12 * 1 + Sigma Z Distributing this product of three sums gives gives us eight terms in total we can do some simplifications here for example Sigma x^2 goes to 1 and we can flip the order of the sigmas here if we change the sign and flip the sigmas here if we also change the sign and set Sigma x^2 to 1 also note that the plus and minus versions of these terms cancel and go to zero we can then group the six remaining terms into Sigma X Sigma Z * Sigma X and sigma Z next I'll distribute the 1/2 and I'm going to rewrite the Z x by Vector in pseudo Vector form as I * Sigma y if we set these terms equal to 3D Vector components XY Z and also change the tri Vector big I to the complex small I we get the exact formulas for converting between 3D Vector components and complex spinner compon components that I showed in spinners for beginners video 7 so in the Clifford algebra cl30 we can successfully factor a 3D Vector into a pair of spinners as expected we just have to keep in mind that the components of this 3D Vector include both scalar parts and pseudoscalar parts now in this video series I've defined Spinners as members of minimal left ideals in Clifford algebras however I mentioned in a previous video that David Honis one of the leading figures in geometric algebra defines Spinners as any sum of even graded elements in a Clifford algebra so why are these two definitions different the link between these two definitions is the poman property recall we can get a left ideal inside our Clifford algebra by applying the algebra onto a projector pz plus from the left left the projection operation squashes our eight-dimensional space into a four-dimensional space in doing so it makes it so that we can no longer tell the difference between elements if they differ by a factor of Sigma Zed for example we can no longer tell the difference between Sigma Y and sigma y * Sigma Z because our pz plus projector eats up the sigma Zed making it disappear this means that that when we have a big Clifford algebra expression like this that is projected using pz plus we can feel free to add or remove Sigma Zeds as we please this means that we have the power to make every term in this expression have an even grade for example the scalar one has grade zero so we leave it alone the vectors Sigma X and sigma y are grade one so we can multiply them by an extra Sigma Zed to make them grade two for the vector Sigma Zed we can remove a factor of Sigma Zed just to get a scalar one which is grade zero all the B vectors are grade two so we leave them alone and the tri Vector is grade three but we can remove a factor of Sigma Zed to make it grade two so by adding and removing Sigma Zeds as needed we have forced every element in this expression to have an even grade and this is completely equal to our original spinner formula all David Honis does for his definition of spinners is simply drop the projection from the right hand side of this expression this even graded element behaves exactly like the PO Spinners we've seen all along it simply doesn't care about the fact that the second column of this Matrix is nonzero since we only care about the First Column anyway if we want to take this Honis Style spinner and recover our minimal left ideal spinner all we need to do is apply it to our projection operator from the left so these two definitions of spinners aren't exactly equal but they are pretty close the only difference between them is whether or not we do a projection operator on the right now let's take what we have for Spinners in cl30 and generalize it to SpaceTime with cl13 and then generalize it further to clpq in the SpaceTime algebra cl13 gamma T squares 2 + 1 and gamma's XY Z Square to minus1 and all basis vectors anti-c commute with each other in total There are 16 independent elements in this Clifford algebra one scaler four vectors Six B vectors four Tri vectors and one quad Vector the quad Vector at the top is also sometimes called the pseudo scaler denoted with a capital I and big I squares to1 however this time big I anti- commutes with vectors inside the algebra so be careful about the ordering when writing out multiplications that involve big I there are two popular Matrix representations for cl13 which are the chyal basis or vile basis and and the mass basis or direct basis as before the first thing we need to get Spinners in a minimal left ideal is a projector element recall that any element of the form 12 * 1 + U where U ^ S 2 + 1 is a projector its complement 1 minus the projector is also a projector in cl13 you might be tempted to reach for a projector like pt+ which is 1 12 * 1 + gamma T however when looking at the Matrix representation of this projector we find it can be written as a sum of two projectors so this projector is not a minimal projector meaning it will not give us a minimal left ideal indeed when we multiply a general 4x4 Matrix onto it from the left we get two nonzero columns instead of just one one solution is to take the result of our projection and put it through yet another projector to get an even smaller ideal the term I gamma X gamma y squares 2 + 1 so this can give us another projector pxy + note that this is the complex number I from the set of scalers used in linear combinations this is not the pseudoscalar big I from our Clifford algebra so we're actually making an assumption here where we're allowed to scale our Clifford algebra elements using complex numbers so we'll add the complex C here to denote this this is different than what we were doing previously in cl30 where we were only using real number scaling coefficients it turns out that if we project with pt+ and then project with pxy + we get a minimal projector p++ and this projects out the minimal left ideal consisting of the first nonzero column in The Matrix representation also the existence of this projector explains why PT Plus is not minimal we can multiply PT Plus by 1 and then rewrite one as a sum of complementary projectors pxy + and pxy minus this gives us two projectors that add up to pt+ proving that that pt+ is not a minimal projector in fact the different combinations of pt+ PT minus pxy + and pxy minus give us four different minimal projectors that all sum to one or the identity Matrix however we're just going to go with the first option since it's the simplest a member of this minimal left ideal is a set of four complex numbers arranged in a column called a direct spinner which we talked about in spinners for beginners number nine so this is the Matrix representation of a direct spinner but what does it look like in terms of abstract Clifford algebra symbols well each of our projectors has its own poman property PT Plus will eat up factors of gamma T and pxy plus will eat up factors of gamma x * gamma y possibly with a complex I or negative sign left over depending on the swap order and coefficients in front however the most important property here is that gamma t commutes with I gamma X gamma y as a result our projectors pt+ and pxy plus also commute so we can change their order at any time this means we can use PT Plus to eat up factors of gamma T then swap the projector order to eat up factors of gamma X gamma Y and then swap back so the order we multiply projectors in doesn't matter we get to use two paman properties at the same time for free this means that when we project our algebra using p++ the elements one the T Vector the XY by vector and the txy tri Vector are all equivalent allowing for different complex number scalings in front the other equivalences are given here so in the end we only have four independent basis Vector elements in our minimal left ideal The Matrix representations for these basis elements are given here you can see that we get four basis elements for the four complex entries in the First Column of our Matrix there's also a way to subdivide a directa spinner into a left chyro vial spinner and a right chyro vial spinner this is done with these two projectors involving the complex small I times the pseudoscalar big I a combination which is sometimes written as gamma 5 for short however note that the direct spinner is Multiplied onto these projectors from the right so these do not belong to smaller left ideals inside our minimal left ideal I'll talk more about left and right chyro vial Spinners in later videos so we see that direct Spinners are members of minimal left ideals in Clifford algebra's cl13 how can we generalize this to clpq the main question is how do we find a minimal projector that will give us a minimal left ideal in a Clifford algebra of arbitrary size this is addressed in a textbook by Lun esto it turns out to be pretty easy if we just follow the pattern established in cl13 if one projector isn't enough to give us a minimal ideal we just keep multiplying more projectors that commute with it until we get a minimal projector let's say we're working in the Clifford algebra cl80 with complex coefficients we have these eight basis vectors that square 2 + 1 one we can collect these basis vectors into bi Vector pairs since the bi vectors have no elements in common all the bi vectors commute with each other you can feel free to check this for yourself however each of these B vectors squares 2 minus one which is not useful for making projectors so we include a scaling factor of the complex I in front of each B Vector which causes all the B vectors to now sare 2 + 1 we can now use these bi vectors to construct commuting projectors using the formula 12 * 1 + U where U is our B Vector time the complex I which squares to + 1 by multiplying all these commuting projectors together we get a minimal projector which can be used to construct a minimal left ideal so for a Clifford algebra built from an even number of basis vectors getting a minimal projector is easy we just group the basis vectors into non-overlapping pairs to make a set of commuting projectors and multiply all the projectors together but what if we have an odd number of basis vectors it turns out the final odd basis Vector will also commute with all other bi vectors as long as no basis vectors are repeated between the bi vectors the final basis Vector also squares 2 + 1 so it can be used to build a final commuting projector so for Clifford algebras with an odd number of basis vectors we use the same procedure as the even case but use the final odd basis Vector to make our final commuting projector now what about clpq where some basis vectors Square 2 minus1 in this case the procedure for building minimal projectors is the exact same except some B vectors will Square to + one all on their own so we don't need to include a factor of the complex I in front we just include or exclude the complex I as needed to ensure the B Vector squares to + one and we use our set of commuting projectors to build our minimal projector in the same way now this procedure does leave some questions first of all how do we know for sure that projectors made from B vectors give us a minimal left ideal with no smaller non-trivial ideals inside also what if we aren't allowed to use complex coefficients as in the case of cl30 with real coefficients how do we know when we've managed to build a minimal projector unfortunately I'm going to have to delay the proofs of this to an appendix video as this video is already too long one last thing I'll mention is that when building Matrix representations of Clifford algebras you should make sure the matrices you use are big enough to hold the algebra for example cl30 with real coefficients is eight real dimensional and the 2x two matrices of complex numbers is also eight real dimensional so you can create a one toone correspondence between the two but cl30 with complex coefficients is 16 real dimensional and so the 2x2 complex matrices are not big enough to hold it if you try to use the standard Sigma matrices you'll end up in a situation where two different elements from the Clifford algebra end up being represented by the same Matrix a matrix representation like this is said to be not faithful we need to increase the size of our matrices to ensure we get faithful representations with a one toone correspondence between Clifford algebra elements and matrices
