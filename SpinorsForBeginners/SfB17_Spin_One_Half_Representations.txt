we're starting a new section of this video series where we talk about Le groups and Lee algebras and how they relate to Spinners in particle physics we classify particles according to their fundamental properties such as mass and electric charge one important fundamental property is the particle spin which is either an integer or a half integer all known fundamental particles have spins of either zero 1 half or one for spin zero we have the higs Bon for spin 1/2 we have the matter type particles like quarks electrons and neutrinos and for spin one we have Force carrying particles like photons gluons and the w and z bosons the value of a particle's spin determines how we describe it in a mathematical equation spin zero particles are represented by scalers spin 1/2 particles are represented by Spinners and spin one particles are represented by vectors the spin value is sort of like the rank of the tensor used to represent the particle scalers are rank zero tensors vectors are rank one tensors and Spinners Loosely speaking are kind of like rank 1/ half tensors since they rotate half as much as vectors do when transformed is it's also possible to combine fundamental particles into composite particles which can have higher spins like three halves these particles are represented by higher dimensional objects that are tensor products of spinners and vectors the hypothetical graviton is Spin 2 and this is related to the fact that the metric tensor from general relativity is a Rank 2 tensor so what does this have to do with Lee algebras and Le groups well it's important to know how a particle will behave when we do a physical transformation like a rotation or boost the various different particle types will transform with different types of matrices for example in 3D vectors will rotate in the XY plane using this Matrix and Spinners will rotate in the XY plane using this Matrix scalers can be thought of as rot ating with a 1 by one Matrix containing the number one this basically means that scalers don't change their value in different rotated coordinate systems we say these matrices belong to Le groups in mathematics a group is a set of elements that can be combined together and Obey certain properties such as having an identity element and inverse elements that undo transformations since we can combine two rotations into another rotation rotate by 0 degrees to get the identity Matrix and take the inverse of rotation matrices to undo rotations sets of rotation matrices form a group a Le group is a group that's continuous instead of discret reflection Transformations are not a Le group because they involve discrete jumps but rotations are a Le group because we can smoothly move from a small rotation to a large rotation every Lee group has a corresponding Lee algebra which is a special set of matrices that we can exponentiate to get Le group matrices understanding these Lee algebras can tell us a lot about how to transform various kinds of particles and all the different types of quantum operators and quantum mechanics belong to various Lee algebras so let's start off by trying to understand how to take the exponent of a matrix this 3x3 Matrix here gives us a rotation in the XY plane by an angle Theta this Matrix is a member of the Le group SO3 the special orthogonal 3x3 matrices which do rotations in 3D orthogonal means the matrix's inverse is its transpose and special means the Matrix determinant is + one now it turns out that this rotation Matrix is equal to the exponential of theta times this special 3x3 Matrix here the Matrix in the exponent is called a generator and is a member of the Lee algebra s SO3 which is written with lowercase letters in a fractor font by convention so how do we make sense of this what does it mean to take the exponential of a matrix the answer lies in the tailor series of e to the X normally this is used when X is an ordinary number but we can replace x with a matrix M to give us this definition of a matrix's exponential while this gives us an infinite Series in our example The Matrix Powers will form a repeating pattern so we actually only need to evaluate the first few Powers so let's evaluate the first few powers of the Matrix M and what we get for M the 0 we're going to say that any Matrix to the power of 0 gives the identity Matrix similar to how any number to the power of0 gives 1 m to the 1 is just the Matrix M itself to calculate m^ 2ar we just do M * m and we get a matrix with the entries - 1 0 01 in the top left corner and all the other entries are zero m 3 just gives M * m^ 2 and after multiplying this out we find the result is M M 4 is m 3 * m which is just m * m or m^ 2 and it turns out that M 5 after using some of the identities we've discovered is just m so this is where the cycle starts repeating in the tailor Series so we take m to the 0o to be the identity Matrix and the next four powers of M just repeat in a cycle forever so let's take the first few terms in our infinite series and plug in these Matrix Powers let's focus on adding together the entries in the top left corner of the Matrix we see this gives us the tailor series for cosine of theta look looking at some of the other entries we get more tailor series for negative sin Theta sin Theta and cosine Theta and the bottom right corner of the Matrix is just one because of the one in the identity Matrix at the start of the series so after using a few tricks with the tailor series we can indeed see that this Matrix exponential gives us a 3X3 rotation Matrix in the XY plane so we know that when we exponentiate this generator Matrix times an angle we get a rotation Matrix in the XY plane but how did I know to use this generator Matrix specifically it turns out that there's a straightforward recipe to go from a Le group Matrix to its Lee algebra generator let's say that we have e to the S Theta where s is just a number if we take the derivative with respect to Theta a factor of s comes down in front by Chain rule next if we set Theta to zero the exponential goes to one and we're left with just s so to isolate s we use two steps take the derivative then set the parameter to zero this recipe works in the case of a matrix M2 taking the derivative with respect to Theta brings a copy of M down in front you can try proving this by taking the derivative of the exponential series if you like next next setting Theta to 0 means e to the 0 Matrix which becomes the identity Matrix so we're left with just the Matrix M which is our generator Matrix so the recipe for getting our generator Matrix m is to take our rotation Matrix R in the Le group take its derivative and then set the parameter to zero let's try this out on our XY rotation Matrix taking the derivative with respect to Theta SS become cosiness and cosiness become negative SS and in the lower right corner the derivative of the constant 1 is 0 then we set Theta to 0 S of 0 gives 0 and cosine of 0 gives 1 so we end up with the generator Matrix I showed earlier in the video as expected you can pause the video and show that these rotation matrices in the y z and ZX planes give these generator matrices from now on I'm going to denote the generator matrices as gxy gy Z and gzx which generate the rotations in the XY y z and ZX planes respectively this is getting a little off topic for this video but it turns out you can also take the exponential of a derivative operator using the tailor series definition if we multiply this derivative by a parameter a and exponentiate it the resulting operator is a machine that translates a function by some amount a you can pause the video if you want to read the full proof of this so just as these 3x3 matrices generate rotation matrices on 3D vectors when exponentiated this derivative operator generates a translation operator on functions when exponentiated this is related to why the momentum operator in quantum mechanics contains a derivative because momentum is the generator of translations and it uses the complex ey to ensure the operator is her Mission I won't say any more about that in this video but I've left some links in the description to videos that go into more detail now let let's get back to our SO3 generator matrices it's worth looking at these generator matrices and seeing if they have anything in common it turns out that the generator matrices of SO3 are all traceless so the sum of their diagonal elements is zero and anti- symmetric so their transpose equals their negative we can go ahead and prove this to prove the traceless property I'm going to start with this theorem which says that for a matrix a the determinant of e to the a is equal to e to the trace of a this is easy to prove if a is a diagonal matrix where its igen values are along the diagonal in this case e to the a just means taking the exponential of the individual diagonal elements and the determinant of this Matrix would just be the product of the diagonal elements on the other hand the trace of a is just the sum of the diagonal elements and if we exponentiate this sum we see it is equal to the determinant we calculated before if we use basic exponent rules now this proof only works for diagonal matrices but since I values the determinant and the trace of a matrix are unchanged by a change of coordinates this proof also works for any Matrix that is diag ionizable our SO3 generator matrices are diagonalizable and so the corresponding rotation matrices are also diagonalizable provided we allow for complex Matrix entries so the theorem we discussed earlier also works for our rotation matrices and their generators as an exercise you can try to figure out why the rotation Matrix and its generator transform using the same coordinate change Matrix c as a hint remember to look at the Taylor series definition of Matrix exponentiation so using this theorem and knowing the determinant of an SO3 Matrix is + one we can write the rotation Matrix in exponential form use the theorem to rewrite it as the exponential of the trace and since this exponential equals 1 for all Theta we must conclude that the trace of the generator m is zero so we've proven that SO3 generator matrices are traceless now let's prove s SO3 generator matrices are anti-symmetric we know that for an SO3 Matrix are its inverse equals its transpose so R * R transpose equals the identity Matrix now let's take the derivative of both sides on the left side we use product rule to get a sum of two products and on the right the identity Matrix is a constant so its derivative is the zero Matrix now we can rewrite the matrices as exponentials of the generators it turns out that the transpose of an exponential is just the exponential of the transpose so we can move this transpose operation to the generator also recall that the derivative of of an exponential just gives us a factor of the generator out in front because of chain Rule now this formula must be true for all values of theta so let's Sub in theta equals 0 this causes all the exponentials to go to the identity Matrix this makes sense because a rotation by 0 de is the identity we're left with the generator plus its transpose equaling the zero Matrix or in other words the transpose of the generator equals the negative generator so this proves that the generators of SO3 matrices are anti-symmetric now I want to give you a warning about proofs that involve Matrix exponentials if you wanted to try proving that s SO3 generators are anti-symmetric you might be tempted to just Sub in these Matrix exponentials and use exponent rules to add the exponents together and use this to conclude that the generator matrices are anti-symmetric but this proof does not work for an important reason when exponentiating matrices we cannot use the exponent rules we use for numbers where we turn a product of exponentials into the exponential of a sum the reason for this is matrix multiplication does not commute in General and because of this the two exponential formulas are not equal when we expand them as an infinite series the two formulas are only equal if the generators commute you can Google The Baker Campbell hous door formula if you want to learn more about this in the case of an anti-symmetric Matrix it does commute with its transpose because we can move the minus sign from one Matrix to the other so the rule for turning a product of exponents into the exponents of a sum does work but we need to prove the two matrices commute before we can use this rule so we've proven that all SO3 generator matrices are traceless and anti-symmetric now I said earlier that these generator matrices are members of a Lee algebra specifically the Lee algebra so 3 but what does that mean exactly remember an algebra is basically a vector space where addition subtraction and multiplication between vectors is defined we can Loosely think of these generator matrices as being like vectors just as we can add and subtract vectors to get more vectors we can also add and subtract generator matrices to get more generator matrices when we we add two traceless anti-symmetric matrices together the result is also traceless and anti-symmetric so we know the result of adding two s SO3 generators is another s SO3 generator the same is true for subtracting generators but in an algebra we also need to be able to multiply vectors together you might assume the multiplication rule between generators is just matrix multiplication a but this isn't quite correct the product of two anti-symmetric matrices is not always anti- symmetric so the result of multiplying two SO3 generators is not always another s SO3 generator that is the exponential of this product doesn't always give us a rotation Matrix in SO3 we can check this explicitly by multiplying the XY generator with the y z generator we get this Matrix here this Matrix actually squares to zero so when we exponentiate it only the first couple terms in the series are nonzero and we get this which is not a rotation Matrix however let's try something else I'll multiply the generators XY and Y Z and then subtract their product in the opposite order y z * XY if we work through the The Matrix multiplications and subtract we get this Matrix which is the ZX generator Matrix so it turns out that when we multiply two generators in either order and subtract the result we get another generator this operation on matrices is called The Matrix commutator and in the context of Lee algebras it is often called the Lee bracket this is what we will use as our Vector multiplication rule rule in Lee algebras since it's a way of combining two generators to give us a third generator if we work out all the commutators for our rotation generators we get these commutation relations here this set of generators of the Le group SO3 along with the rules for addition subtraction and multiplication with the Lee bracket form the Lee algebra SO3 again Lee algebras are conventionally written using lowercase letters with a fractor font in some more abstract books you might see the Lee bracket defined like this using the alternating and jacobe properties instead but the Matrix commutator satisfies both of these properties so the Matrix commutator is a valid Lee bracket to discuss these SO3 commutation Rel further I'm going to rewrite our SO3 generators as G1 G2 and G3 now in a General Lee algebra when we have a set of basis generators the Lee bracket of two basis generators doesn't always give us back another basis generator however the Le bracket result will always give us a linear combination of basis generators the coefficients in this linear combination denoted f with indices i j k are called the structure coefficients for this lee algebra if we look specifically at the Lee algebra SO3 we can get the structure coefficients by looking at the first second and third Lee brackets and then noting that the commutator is anti-symmetric so we get a sign change when we swap the lower two indices of the coefficients all other coefficients are zero this is sometimes summarized using the antisymmetric symbol Epsilon also called the Levi chiita symbol now how do we know these commutators will always give us a linear combination of generators to prove this I need to talk about how a Lee algebra is like a tangent space at the identity element of its correspond lead group remember a lead group is a group that's continuous so it forms a continuous curved space which is also called a manifold each point in this space would be a different SO3 rotation Matrix let's imagine that this curve in our Le group space is a path containing all the rotation matrices in the XY plane that we get by increasing Theta the point on this path where theta equals 0 would be the identity Matrix since a rotation by 0 de is the identity when we take the derivative with respect to Theta it's like we're looking at the tangent vectors along this curve and when we set Theta to zero this means we're looking at the tangent Vector specifically located at the identity element so the derivative at theta equals 0 is a tangent Vector located at the identity Matrix so we can think of our generator Matrix as being a tangent Vector at the origin or identity of our Le group the set of all generators is like a flat space that's tangent to the Le group at the identity keep in mind s SO3 is actually a three-dimensional space with three basis elements but I'm drawing it as a 2d tangent plane just because that's easier to visualize now I'm going to use this idea of paths in the curved Lee group space to prove some properties about General Lee algebras so instead of dealing with Lee group members that are rotations in SO3 parameterized by angles I'm going to deal with General members of a general Le Group Big G whose generators live in the Lee algebra small G I've taken these proofs from the textbook naive Lee Theory by John Stillwell first let's prove the sum of two tangent vectors in a General Lee algebra will give another tangent Vector let's take group members a of S and B ofs in the leag group Big G these describe two paths in the lead Group parameterized by S when s equals 0 both of these give the identity transformation and their derivatives at s equal 0 give their generators which I'll write as small a and small B if we multiply the group members a of S and B of s we get a new group member C of s let's take the derivative of both sides and set s to zero on the right side we use the product rule when we set s to zero B of s and a of s just become the identity element and when we look at the derivatives at s equals 0 we get the generators a plus b so we see the sum of tangent vectors small a plus small B gives another tangent Vector which is the vector tangent to the curve C of s at the identity I'm going to make a small aside here to explain the difference between a generator and a tangent vector I've already explained that with Matrix exponentials the product of two Matrix exponentials is not always equal to the exponential of the sum however if we expand these two formulas out as tailor series it turns out that the first order terms in both series are equal even though the later terms in the series are not equal this means that both of these formulas have the same tangent Vector at the identity it's important to keep in mind that there are an infinite number of possible curves that go through the identity that have the same tangent Vector at the identity however when we're treating this tangent Vector as a generator and exponentiating it it only generates one unique curve in the lead Group which is the unique curve we get when we exponentiate the tangent Vector multiplied by a curve parameter now let's prove the scalar multiple of a tangent Vector gives another tangent Vector let's take the path a of s in the group and multiply the parameter s by some constant R to give us a of R * s now let's take the derivative and set s to zero using chain rule we get a factor of R out in front and the derivative at s equals 0 becomes the generator small a so we see that the scalar multiple of tangent Vector small a gives another tangent Vector which is tangent to the curve a of R * s so we've shown that we can add tangent vectors together and scale them to get more tangent vectors this is the basic definition of a vector space but to prove that the set of tangent vectors forms a Lee algebra we need to prove the commutator of tangent vectors gives tangent Vector to prove this we'll look at a path in the group Big G with three legs a of s then B of T then a inverse of s which takes us along the path a of s but in the opposite direction we'll call this path D of s and t and it has two parameters this ABA inverse formula is called a conjugation if we take a con Conant s and take the derivative with respect to T the derivative only affects B of T since a of s doesn't depend on T then if we set T equals z we get the Lee algebra generator small B now let's take the derivative with respect to S which gives us a product rule on the right hand side if we set s equal to zero both a of s and a inverse of s go to the identity element the derivative of a at zero becomes the generator small a and the derivative of a inverse at 0 is just the generator that points in the opposite direction which is small a so we get small a small B minus small B small a which is the commutator of small a and small B now what exactly is this object on the left hand side where we've taken the derivative with respect to two different parameters for constant s d of s and t is just a path in the Le group that depends on T and when we take the derivative with respect to T and set T to 0 this becomes a tangent Vector in the tangent space located at tals 0 allowing s to vary every value of s gives us a different tangent Vector in the tangent space so we get a continuous path of tangent vectors parameterized by S if we then take the derivative with respect to S we get tangent vectors along this path and setting s to zero gives us the specific tangent Vector at the identity now since tangent vectors in a vector space Also belong to that same Vector space this tangent Vector at s equal 0 also belongs to the tangent space of of our original path in the Le group at T equals 0 so all of that shows that the commutator of two tangent vectors gives another tangent Vector so the tangent space of a leag group at the identity does indeed form a Lee algebra so let's review what we've discovered so far about the Lee group SO3 we found that each of the three rotation matrices has a generator Matrix and we can exponentiate the generator times the angle to get the rotation Matrix the two-step process for getting these generators is to take the derivative of the rotation Matrix and then set the parameter to zero using the algebraic properties of matrices we found that the generators of the SO3 Le group are the set of traceless anti-symmetric matrices we also proved that the commutator of generators always gives a member in the tangent space of generators at the identity according to these rules here now let's repeat this process for the lorence groupo +13 this is the set of SpaceTime Transformations that keep the space-time interval with one plus sign and three minus signs unchanged the special s means the Matrix determinant is + one and so spatial Reflections are forbidden the plus means the top left element of the Matrix is positive and so time Reflections are forbidden this group includes three rotation and three Lorent boost matrices we can get the generators for these matrices the usual Way by taking the derivative and setting the parameter to zero the rotation generators denoted with J's are traceless and anti-symmetric as we saw before the Boost generators denoted with Ks are traceless and symmetric these six generators form a basis for the Lee algebra s +13 we can also work out the commutators for these matrices to get these commutation relations here this is the Le bracket rule in the S so13 Lee algebra note that the commutator of two rotation generators gives a rotation generator the commutator of two boost generators also gives a rotation generator and the commutator of a rotation generator and a boost generator gives a boost generator this shows us that the S SO3 Le algebra lives inside the S so +13 Lee algebra so in this video we've looked at the Le groups s SO3 and S so +13 and discovered their respective Lee algebras but these Le group matrices only operate on vectors SO3 matrices operate on 3D space vectors and S so plus 13 matrices operate on 4D space-time vectors since vectors are rank one tensors we say these matrices are part of the spin one representation this helps us understand how the spin one particles behave when we do rot ations and boosts but what about other particles like the spin 1/2 particles this will be covered in the next video where I cover the spin 1/2 representation which is one of the multiple different representations of the SO3 and S so +13 Lee algebras if you've ever seen the complex number I represented as a matrix that squares to the negative identity you might know that there are multiple different matrices of all different sizes that satisfy this property the same is true for our Lee algebra generators we've seen the 3X3 SO3 generator matrices and the 4x4 so +13 generator matrices these are from the spin one representation because they transform vectors however we can also find 2x two matrices that follow the same Lee algebra rules in both cases these are from the spin 1/2 representation because they transform Spinners I'll go through all of this in the next video also one final note depending on the textbook you read you might see that the generators I've shown for rotations and boosts look a little different depending on whether they follow the math convention or the physics convention in this video I follow the math convention where the generators of 3D rotation matrices are traceless and anti-symmetric in the physics convention it's often the case that the generators are multiplied by netive I where I is the imaginary unit this makes them traceless and hermiss matrices where Herm Mission means a matrix equals its complex conjugate transpose to compensate for this extra Factor of minus I there needs to be an additional factor of I with the opposite sign used in the exponential to cancel it out physicists use this convention because observables in quantum mechanics must be represented by Herm Mission operators which end up being the same thing as Lee algebra generators this hermiss property is required so that observables like momentum and spin always give real numbers instead of complex numbers in the case of rotations the generators will be Herm mission in the physics convention instead of anti-symmetric as with the math convention pure mathematicians don't require this Herm Mission condition and so they don't bother with these extra factors of I in the generators or the exponential formula
