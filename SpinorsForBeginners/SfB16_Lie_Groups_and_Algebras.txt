this is the final video where we discuss Spinners as members of Clifford algebras in the previous video we discussed how Spinners are members of minimal left ideals in Clifford algebras the easiest way to get a minimal left ideal is to find a minimal projector or item potent element that creates a minimal left ideal in this video we're going to talk about nil potent Elements which are elements that square to zero and we'll see how nil poent can create projectors which can then create minimal left ideals for us I'm also going to discuss maximally isotropic subspaces and their relationship to minimal left ideals we'll see that as an isotropic Subspace gets bigger and bigger the corresponding ideal will get smaller and smaller now to start this video I'm going to talk about a concept in quantum mechanics called creation and annihilation operators these operators are used to create and Destroy particles in multi-particle quantum mechanics and Quantum field Theory I don't expect you to be too familiar with this but I've left some links in the description to videos that discuss them in more detail if you've ever studied the quantum harmonic oscillator you'll know that one way to solve for the energy levels is to use the so-called raising and lowering operators also called ladder operators these can be used to travel between the various quantized energy states of the oscillator also the commutator of the raising and lowering operators equals 1 when we upgrade to multiparticle Quantum Mechanics we get similar operators that allow us to create particles and destroy or annihilate particles and they obey a similar commutation relation these operator work for particles called bons the defining property of bons is that multiple bons are allowed to occupy the same Quantum State the photon is an example of a bozon the other main category of particles is ferons the defining property of Fons is that they obey the PO Exclusion Principle which says that two Fons cannot exist in the same state at the same time matter type particles like quarks electrons and neutrinos are examples of Fons now let's look at the operators related to creating and destroying ferons so with Fons we only have two valid States the empty State and the full or occupied state which has a particle in it we'll say that the operator Alpha plus is the creation operator that takes the empty State and and creates a firon particle giving us the full or occupied state so Alpha plus acting on the empty State gives us the full State conversely we'll say the operator Alpha minus is the annihilation operator it takes the full State destroys the firmon particle and Returns the empty state so Alpha minus acting on the full State gives us the empty State now what would happen if we appli the creation operator to the full State creating another firon would imply we have two firion in the same state which is impossible so we say this is equal to zero this zero indicates that the probability of getting two or more Fons in the same state is zero similarly when we apply the annihilation operator to the empty State this would imply we have less than zero particles which is impossible so we say that this equals z as well if we examine these rules a little more we get some interesting results what happens when we apply the creation operator twice to the empty State the first operator fills the state and the second Operator just gives us zero and if we apply two creation operators to the full State we immediately get zero as a result so regardless of the initial State applying the creation operator twice gives us zero the same is true for applying the annihilation operator twice applying two Annihilation operators to the full State the first one empties the state and the second one gives zero and applying to Annihilation operators to the empty State gives us zero immediately so applying to Annihilation operators always gives zero so both Alpha plus and Alpha minus Square to Z we say an operator that squares to zero is called nil potent so both the creation and Annihilation operators for Fons are nil potent you might also see elements with this property called isotropic or null although this language is more often used in the case of vectors another interesting property involves the anti commutator of alpha minus and Alpha plus the anticommutator is usually denoted with these curly braces and represents adding the products of the two operators in the forwards and backwards directions let's apply the anti commutator to the empty State we distribute and get two terms for the first term we create on the empty state to get full and then destroy full to get empty again on the second term we destroy the empty state so we get zero overall applying the anticommutator to the empty State just gives us the empty State again now let's apply the anticommutator to the full State again we get two terms in the first term we try creating on the full state so we get zero in the second term we destroy the full state to get empty and then create to get full again so the anticommutator on the full State gives us the full State what this means is that the anticommutator of alpha minus and Alpha plus equals 1 because whichever State we apply it to is just returned to us without any changes we can also Express the nil potent of alpha minus and Alpha Plus in terms of anticommutator by saying that the anticommutator of alpha minus with itself is zero and the anticommutator of alpha a plus with itself is zero these three anti-commutation relations fully describe the creation and Annihilation operators for Fons now what can we do with this it turns out that the nil potent operators we just discovered the creation and Annihilation operators for Fons can be used to build projectors that give us minimal left ideals in Clifford algebras when we take the nil potent elements and form their anticommutator we see it gives one it turns out that the two terms in the anticommutator are orthogonal projector partners that sum to one similar to the projectors we've come across in the last couple videos if you like you can pause the video and try to prove that each of these two elements are projectors that is they Square to themselves but I'm going to go ahead and prove it now now let's take p+ which equals Alpha minus Alpha plus and show that it squares to itself we get a product of four operators and we can take the inner Alpha plus Alpha minus and notice that it matches this term In our anti-commutation relation this means we can rewrite it as 1 minus Alpha minus Alpha plus after we distribute the first term becomes Alpha minus Alpha plus and the second term has Alpha minus twice which immediately goes to zero since it's nil potent so we end up with Alpha minus Alpha plus which is the original projector p+ so p+ does Square to itself meaning that p+ is a projector we can use a similar proof to show that P minus is a projector you can also pause and try to show that P plus and P minus are orthogonal that is their product in either direction is zero p+ * P minus gives us Alpha plus twice in the middle which goes to zero because it's nil potent and in the other direction P minus * p+ Alpha minus twice in the middle goes to zero because it's nil potent so using our nil potent elements Alpha minus and Alpha plus we're able to Define two orthogonal projectors p+ and P minus that sum to one before we defined projectors by finding an element u in our Clifford algebra that squared 2 + 1 and then using the Formula 1 12 * 1 + U to define a projector but now we have an alternative method for constructing projectors that uses nil potent that anti- commute to one so to some everything up we have two nil potents Alpha minus and Alpha plus that square to zero and also anti commute to one we can use these nil potents to Define projectors p+ and P minus which Square to themselves these projectors are orthogonal and multiply with each other to give zero we can also reinterpret this anti-commutation relation to mean that the two orthogonal projectors sum to one so all of this so far might seem a bit abstract we've been talking about nil potent and projectors in abstract terms but I haven't yet connected this back to Clifford algebras to get a concrete example let's look at the SpaceTime algebra cl13 where the basis Vector gamma T squares 2 + 1 and the basis vectors gamma's XY Z all square to - one and all the basis vectors anti commute with each other vectors in space time that point along the directions of light beams are called lightlike vectors and these lightlike vectors Square to zero for this reason we also say that lightlike vectors are null isotropic or nil potent a simple lightlike Vector is gamma t plus gamma Zed it's easy to see this Vector squares to zero the inner terms cancel because they anticommute and the outer terms become 1 - one which goes to zero so this lightlike Vector can be thought of as a nil potent element the vector gamma T minus gamma Zed which represents a light beam pointing in the minus Z direction also squares to zero for reasons that we'll see later I'm going to multiply both of the these vectors by 1/ 12 this doesn't change the fact that they're nil potent I'm going to call these two vectors Alpha plus and Alpha minus we can check that the product of these nil potent elements give projectors we'll Define p+ as Alpha minus * Alpha plus expanding all this out we get 1 12 * 1 + gamma T gamma Z this gamma T gamma Zed by Vector squares 2 + 1 so this looks like the projectors we're familiar with from previous videos we also Define p minus to be Alpha plus * Alpha minus this gives us the complimentary projector 1 12 * 1 - gamma T gamma Zed it's easy to see that when we add these two projectors we get 1 or equivalently the anticommutator of our two nil potent is one this is why we multiplied our nil potent by a factor of 1/2 we wanted to make sure the anticommutator gave us one instead of four so let's review what we've done here we started with our SpaceTime algebra cl13 then we found a pair of nil potent elements Alpha plus and Alpha minus that anticommute 2 one we then used the products of these nil potents to give us project s we can now use one of these projectors to give us a left ideal by multiplying the entire algebra onto the projector from the left a procedure we talked about in the previous two videos however we saw in the last video that one projector in cl13 is not enough to give us a minimal ideal there are still smaller ideals inside our current ideal so we need to find another projector to make our ideal even smaller we can do this by finding another pair of nil potent elements I'm going to choose beta plus which is 12 * I gamma x + gamma Y and beta minus which is 1 12 * I gamma x minus gamma y you can go ahead and check for yourself that these elements Square to zero and also anti- commute to one another important property is that the betas an commute with the alphas so we can swap the order of an alpha and a beta in exchange for a negative sign the reason this is important is because it means projectors built from alphas and projectors built from betas will commute with each other remember the reason we care about commuting projectors is because the product of commuting projectors is also a projector if we Define the projector Q Plus and Q minus using the products of the betas we get these projectors that we saw in the previous video if we multiply p+ and q+ we can rewrite the projectors out in terms of our Alpha and beta nil potent we can then swap beta minus over in exchange for two negative signs and then swap beta plus over in exchange for two negative signs overall there is no sign ch change and we've managed to swap the order of the alphas and betas which means we've swapped the order of our projectors so just to make this clear when we build projectors from pairs of nil potents where the nil potents between the pairs anti commute with each other we end up with projectors that commute with each other now we can take our ideal produced by p+ and multiply it onto the commuting projector q+ this gives us an even smaller ideal which in fact happens to be a minimal ideal so this is where Spinners live in the SpaceTime algebra okay let's go over this procedure again from the beginning and this time I'm going to explain how this relates to the concept of maximally isotropic subspaces remember the general procedure for building Spinners is to find a pair of nil potents that anti commute to one then use them to build projectors then use the projectors to project out an ideal from our algebra however we need to remember that Spinners live in a minimal ideal an ideal set in our algebra that contains no sub ideals inside of it except for the trivial ideal consisting of just the zero element let's say that we find a projector that gives us an ideal but the ideal is not minimal because it has a non-trivial ideal inside of it this means we need to continue using more and more projectors to shrink our ideal so that it's smaller and smaller until we reach a minimal ideal so let's start with our n potents Alpha plus and Alpha minus that we've shown here I've already said that nil potent vectors are also called isotropic vectors so we can think of our nil potent Vector Alpha plus as spanning an isotropic space which is a space where all elements Square to zero this space is just a line since it only has one basis vector or more technically since we're allowing for complex scaling coefficients we can think of our isotropic space as one complex dimensional visualized as the complex plane now if we use these nil potents to build a projector we get an ideal but it's not a minimal ideal so we need another projector to make our ideal smaller another way of saying this is that we need to make our isotropic Subspace bigger we need more nil potent so that we can make more projectors so that we can make our ideal smaller so we introduce nil potent beta plus and beta minus now we can take our isotropic Subspace spanned by Alpha plus and and expand it by including the span of beta plus this isotropic Subspace is now two complex dimensional also a key property is that the basis vectors for this space Alpha plus and beta plus anti commute with each other another way of saying this is that the alpha plus and beta plus vectors are orthogonal basis vectors since in Clifford algebras orthogonal vectors anti- commute with each other remember this makes it so that the resulting projectors commute with each other the fact that Alpha plus and beta plus anti- commute also ensures that every Vector in their span is also isotropic if we take any linear combination of alpha plus and beta plus and multiply it by itself the outer terms go to zero because the vectors are isotropic and the inner terms go to Zero by the anti-commutation property so we get zero overall so this anti-commuting property of the isotropic basis vectors ensures every Vector in this Subspace is also isotropic hence the name isotropic Subspace using our expanded isotropic Subspace we can build more projectors which give us a smaller ideal and in fact this smaller ideal is a minimal ideal in cl13 so it turns out that the isotropic Subspace we've built here is a maximally isotropic Subspace it's the largest possible isotropic Subspace we can build inside this Clifford algebra so the rule is we start with nil potents from an isotropic Subspace in our Clifford algebra then use them to build a projector to get an ideal if we need a smaller ideal we expand our isotropic Subspace to get another projector to get a smaller ideal the larger our isotropic Subspace the smaller our ideal we keep expanding our isotropic Subspace until we reach a maximally isotropic Subspace which means we can produce the smallest possible ideal which is a minimal left ideal so the key idea from this video is in order to build minimal left ideals where Spinners live we need to build projectors using nil potence from a maximally isotropic Subspace so let's generalize this procedure to a general Clifford algebra let's start with cn0 with complex coefficients where all our basis vectors Square 2 + 1 Let's assume that we have an even number of basis vectors we can build nil potent by grouping the basis vectors into pairs the elements 12 * Sigma 1+ plus I Sigma 2 and 12 * Sigma 1us I Sigma 2 are nil potents that anti- commute to one we can build more nil potent pairs that anti-c commute to one using similar formulas making sure that no basis vectors are used in more than one pair note that all the alpha pluses and Alpha minuses from different pairs anti- commute with each other this means that all the alphas from different pairs are mutually orthogonal with each other this means that the set of alpha pluses form an orthogonal basis for our maximally isotropic Subspace we use all our nil potents to build projectors and we multiply all our projectors together to get a minimal projector which gives us a minimal left ideal which is where Spinners live now what about clpq with complex coefficients here vectors can square to + one or minus1 so how do we build nil potent here our nil potent will always take this form as 1/2 times the sum or difference of two vectors the first Vector must Square to + one and the second Vector must Square to minus1 so if both vectors Square 2 + 1 then the second Vector needs a factor of the complex I so it squares to -1 if the first Vector squares 2 + 1 and the second Vector squares 2 minus1 we can just leave them as they are with no complex factors if the first Vector squares to minus one and the second Vector squares 2 + 1 then both vectors need factors of the complex I and if both vectors Square 2 minus one then the first Vector needs a factor of the complex I other than that the steps are the exact same build a maximally isotropic Subspace from the nil potent use the nil potent to build a minimal projector and use the projector to get a minimal left ideal where Spinners live now note that this procedure only works in Clifford algebras where P plus Q is an even number because we need an even number of basis vectors to build pairs of nil potent elements let's finish off this video with a concrete example of building Spinners in cl20 with complex coefficients cl20 is not a very big Clifford algebra it has one scaler two vectors and one B Vector we can scale by complex coefficients so you can think of this as four complex dimensional or eight real dimensional this actually ends up being equivalent to cl30 with real coefficient under this isomorphism we can build our pair of nil potents that anti- commute to one as follows we can then use the nil potence to build these projectors when we apply our four complex dimensional algebra onto p12 plus from the left we end up with a minimal left ideal that is two complex dimensional it is spanned by our projector and sigma 1 times our projector so we can build Spinners as linear combinations with these two basis elements also notice that we can take Sigma 1 * the projector and use a bunch of algebra to rewrite it as Alpha plus * the projector this is an equivalent way of writing our spinner components this gives us a two component spinner in c20c you might notice that the first component looks a little bit like an empty firon State and the second component looks a bit like a filled Fon State Cole Fury makes note of this fact as well in her playlist when she refers to this as a fox space however at this point I don't see any reason to literally view these components as filled and empty States this mathematical analy with fermion is just something I used to help us understand nil potent better as far as I'm concerned these are just two basis Spinners used to make a spinner in cl20 they're not actual filled or empty States if we go to higher Dimensions the basis elements for Spinners will include all possible combinations of nil potent acting on the projector so this is the last video that discusses Spinners in terms of Clifford algebras I realize a lot of the concepts in the last few videos have been very abstract but learning them is helpful for working with spinners in arbitrary Dimensions hopefully these videos will make it easier to understand textbooks and papers that talk about minimal left ideals and maximally isotropic subspaces you can also check out this playlist by Cole Fury which helped me understand how nil potent can be used to build projectors and how projectors give us Spinners I've linked it in the descript deson in the next video we'll start talking about how Le groups and Lee algebras relate to spinners
