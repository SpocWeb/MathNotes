in this video we're going to discuss how the matter and radiation in the universe can be modeled as a perfect fluid we'll talk about how this fluid is at rest with respect to a frame of reference called the cosmic rest frame remember we've been modeling the universe according to the cosmological principle which postulates that the universe is spatially homogeneous meaning it looks the same at all points and spatially isotropic meaning it looks the same in all directions in the previous videos we examined the left side of the einstein field equations according to the cosmological principle and this led us to the flrw metric in this video we're going to look at the right side of the einstein field equations according to the cosmological principle and we'll see that the energy momentum tensor represents a fluid with uniform mass density rho and uniform pressure p specifically we'll look at the case of a perfect fluid whose energy momentum tensor with one raised index and one lowered index looks like this with the energy and pressure on the diagonal and zeros everywhere else this tensor also represents a perfect fluid in the rest frame of the fluid and the rest frame of the mass and radiation in the universe is called the cosmic rest frame so i'm going to cover three topics in this video first i'll cover the energy momentum tensor for a perfect fluid then i'll explain what the cosmic rest frame is and finally i'll talk about the equation of state for our perfect fluid before we start let's do a quick review of the energy momentum tensor which i'll call the em tensor for short we discussed this in more detail in relativity 107e but the em tensor helps us keep track of the total amount of four momentum inside a three-dimensional box in space-time the alpha beta component of the energy momentum tensor counts the flux of alpha momentum going through a unit box at constant beta for example if we look at an xyz box at a constant time this will give us four components of the em tensor where the second index is time we can count up all the four momentum of the particles and radiation inside and we'll get four components for the total time x y and z momentum these give the t t x t y t and z t components of the energy momentum tensor respectively these are basically the densities of four momentum over space similarly if we look at a ty z box at a constant x this will give us four components of the e m tensor where the second index is x counting up all the four momentum components gives us the t x x xx yx and zx components of the em tensor these are basically the current densities or fluxes of four momentum along the x direction and we get similar results for a txz box at a constant y and a t x y box at a constant z recall the time component of four momentum is just energy and the flux across a box of constant time is just density since that's just counting the number of something in a spatial box at a constant time we can identify the components of the em tensor as energy density energy flux momentum density and momentum flux the momentum flux can be broken up into pressure where the momentum is perpendicular to a surface and shear stress where the momentum is parallel to the surface also the em tensor is symmetric so we can swap the indices without changing the value so given that review we're ready to describe our spatially homogeneous and isotropic universe as a perfect fluid which is a fluid that exerts pressure equally in all directions in flat space time the perfect fluid em tensor looks like this with equal pressure in all directions and an energy density given by mass density rho times c squared this is like e equals m c squared but divided by volume to write the energy density as the mass density times c squared all other components are zero because perfect fluids have no shear stresses or viscosity so this is the energy momentum tensor for a perfect fluid in the flat space time of special relativity and i should also mention that the components you see here in this matrix are measured relative to the rest frame of the fluid so it's measured in a reference frame where the fluid is stationary and not traveling through space now let's try and find the equivalent perfect fluid energy momentum tensor for the curved space time of general relativity first we can take the matrix and write it as a sum of two matrices the first has energy density plus pressure in the top left entry and the second has pressure along the main diagonal but the first entry has negative pressure to cancel out the positive pressure that we added in the first matrix then we factor out rho plus p over c squared from the first matrix and leave c squared in the first entry then we factor p from the second matrix the first matrix can now be written as the outer product of a column vector and a row vector each with c in the first entry and zeros everywhere else i'm also going to factor a negative one from the second matrix to flip all the signs in it now if you recall the components of the four velocity vector are given in this column multiplied by the gamma factor but if we look at the four velocity vector for a particle at rest with zero velocity this particle has a gamma factor of one and so the resulting components look like this so these two vectors are really the four velocity vectors for a particle that's at rest moving through time but not moving in space so for a flat space time we can write the perfect fluid energy momentum tensor in abstract notation like this where these become the tensor product of four velocity vectors and this becomes the flat minkowski metric eta also note that we're using the mostly minus metric convention so we use a minus sign in this equation if we're using the mostly plus metric convention this sign becomes a plus sign instead to get the equivalent version of a perfect fluid em tensor for curved space time we just take the flat metric eta and replace it with a general metric g so this is the abstract formula for the em tensor of a perfect fluid but if we choose a basis we can write the tensor as a linear combination of this basis and so we get the components of the em tensor the components of the four velocities and the components of the inverse metric since we're dealing with upper indices so this is the em tensor for a perfect fluid with upper indices but we can also get a version with one upper and one lower index if we lower one of the indices using a summation with the metric this will lower one of the four velocity indices and this inverse metric and metric cancel to give a chronic delta or identity matrix to get the em tensor with lowered indices we can sum with another metric this lowers the other four velocity index and the identity matrix times the metric just gives the metric now for our universe obeying the cosmological principle we use the flrw metric as discussed in relativity 110b and 110c the four velocity vector with lowered indices equals the ordinary four velocity summed with the metric which looks like this if we expand the summation let's look at the special case of the u0 component for the flrw metric g00 equals positive one but all these other metric components go to zero so for the flrw metric u0 with a lowered index equals u0 with an upper index so looking at all these different em tensors for the flrw metric in the rest frame of the fluid u0 lower and u0 upper are both equal to c and the spatial components are all zero so if we look at the em tensor with one upper and one lower index also called mixed indices in the rest frame both u vectors look like this and the identity matrix looks like this so we can multiply these distribute and then add the matrices together to get this result for the em tensor with upper indices we get a similar formula except we use the inverse flrw metric where the zero zero component is plus one as we said before but the spatial components are more complicated so i'm just going to write them as gij with upper indices so the final result looks like this and for the em tensor with lower indices it looks the exact same except with the ordinary metric with lower indices instead so these are all the various perfect fluid energy momentum tensors in the rest frame coordinates of the fluid for the flrw metric using the mostly minus metric signature now i'd like to bring up a couple concerns so we know that this energy momentum tensor represents the matter and radiation in the universe as a fluid that's at rest but with respect to which frame is the fluid at rest in special and general relativity there should be no objective frame that's at rest since all inertial frames should be equivalent to each other so it would make sense to talk about a fluid that's at rest inside a cup because we could just use the rest frame of the cup but here we're talking about the whole universe so how could the whole universe have a rest frame the next concern is this flrw metric that we've been talking about the metric has the spatial scaling factor a of t but which reference frame does the time coordinate t and a of t belong to in special and general relativity there should be no objective t-coordinate since every frame of reference will have its own t-coordinate so whose time coordinate is this both of these concerns with the rest frame of the em tensor and the scale factor's time coordinate can be answered at the same time it turns out that all the matter in the universe does actually have a rest frame called the cosmic rest frame in the relativity 110a video i talked about how if we look up at the sky from different parts of the earth we'll measure the cosmic microwave background radiation coming at us from all directions in half of the sky the cmb radiation will be more redshifted and in the other half of the sky the radiation will be more blue shifted basically since the earth is traveling through an ocean of cmb radiation the radiation will be more redshifted on the half of the sky that the earth is traveling away from and the radiation will be more blue shifted on the half of the sky that the earth is traveling toward now most frames of reference for all these stars and planets in the universe will have the cmb radiation doppler shifted along one direction or another but there is one specific frame where the cmb radiation has no doppler shift the frame of reference where this happens is called the cosmic rest frame the cosmic rest frame is the unique frame of reference where there is no observed doppler shift in the cmb radiation and the cmb radiation's frequencies look the same in all directions this is also the frame where if we zoom out on large scales and divide the universe up into boxes hundreds of millions of light years wide then the average velocity of all the masses inside these boxes will be zero basically inside these boxes there will be planets and stars traveling in all sorts of directions but if we average over all the masses in the box the velocities will all cancel out with each other and will average to zero now hearing about the cosmic rest frame you might get the feeling that it's not any different than the ether reference frame that was proposed in the late 1800s but the cosmic rest frame and the ether are not the same thing the reason that physicists proposed the ether is that maxwell's equations predicted that light waves had a speed of 300 million meters per second in a vacuum but the equations didn't specify which frame this speed was measured relative to the ether was proposed as a special reference frame that light travels in and maxwell's equations would only work when calculated relative to the ether frame special and general relativity reject the existence of the ether special and general relativity claim that all laws of physics including the speed of light c and maxwell's equations are the same in all frames of reference although special relativity ignores the laws of gravity in these relativity theories the equations describing the laws of physics are the same in every single frame whether the frames are inertial or non-inertial as long as we write the laws of physics using invariant four-dimensional tensors the equations describing the laws of physics will be the same in all frames so the cosmic rest frame in general relativity has nothing to do with the laws of physics working or not working in special frames the cosmic rest frame is really about the distribution of radiation and matter in our universe if you fly around in space in a rocket in most frames the cmb radiation will have a doppler shift but there's one specific frame where you'll see no doppler shift in the cmb radiation in this frame you are basically at rest with respect to the ocean of cmb radiation this is the frame in which we plan to measure the components of our energy momentum tensor for the perfect fluid that describes the matter and radiation in our universe when we observe the universe from the cosmic rest frame we will get three-dimensional spatial slices of space-time and these three-dimensional spatial slices can be defined by the r theta and phi space coordinates used in the flrw co-moving coordinates and the space-time direction that's orthogonal to these spatial slices defines the time coordinate t for the scale factor a of t so the t in a of t is the time coordinate of the cosmic rest frame so to conclude this section of the video in a universe that's changing in spatial scale like ours there is a choice of frame at every spatial point where there is no observed doppler shift in the cmb radiation and the average velocity of matter at large scales is zero collectively all these frames at all the spatial points in the universe are called the cosmic rest frame this is the frame that comes from the distribution of matter and radiation in the universe the laws of physics are still the same in every frame as expected in special and general relativity but the cosmic rest frame lets us define motion relative to the cosmic microwave background radiation now you might wonder what if the universe was empty how would we define the cosmic rest frame then and it turns out that you can't in this case all of space-time becomes homogeneous and isotropic not just the spatial slices an empty universe with zero curvature is minkowski space the flat space time from special relativity an empty universe with positive curvature is called deceiter space and an empty universe with negative curvature is called anti-dissider space these are the space-time versions of flat space spherical space and hyperbolic space we'll cover them in more detail in the next video when we see how the friedman equations define the evolution of the universe over time the last thing i'll talk about in this video is called the equation of state for the universe the idea of an equation of state comes from thermodynamics and chemistry where we relate variables that describe the state of a system like pressure volume density and temperature together in an equation the most famous equation of state is the ideal gas law which relates pressure volume temperature and the number of moles of the gas we're going to need an equation of state that relates the energy density and pressure of the perfect fluid we're using to model the matter and radiation in our universe now there are any number of different equations of state we could come up with relating density pressure and temperature but as a first step we're just going to choose the simplest thing possible and set the energy density to be proportional to the pressure with a constant of proportionality w so according to this equation of state if density goes up pressure goes up and if density goes down pressure goes down this might not be the most accurate equation of state for the universe but generally speaking it's good to start with something simple and then improve it later on if it gives us bad results using language from the study of fluids we're assuming our perfect fluid is a barotropic fluid which means a fluid whose density only depends on pressure and no other state variables now let's look at how the value of w affects our energy momentum tensor if we set w to zero this means the pressure is set to zero and we're only left with mass density this gives us an energy momentum tensor for dust which is suitable for describing massive matter that doesn't exert any pressure what if we wanted to describe radiation instead of matter well the energy momentum tensor for pure electromagnetic radiation looks like this where f is the faraday tensor this looks complicated but if we take the trace of this tensor we find that all the terms cancel and we get zero so the energy momentum tensor for pure radiation has zero trace given our perfect fluid energy momentum tensor its trace is the energy density minus three times the pressure so the only way to set this to zero is if energy density equals one third of the pressure so the equation of state for pure radiation involves a w factor of one-third between energy density and radiation one last case to try is setting w to negative one here pressure equals negative energy density so we end up getting an energy momentum tensor with mixed indices that's just the energy density times the identity matrix and we can lower the indices with a metric tensor and get this now notice that this energy momentum tensor is just a constant times the metric and that's exactly what the cosmological constant term looks like in the einstein field equations if we replace the cosmological constant term with an energy density term and bring it over to the other side it looks exactly like an energy momentum tensor where the equation of state parameter w is negative one for this reason the cosmological constant is said to be like an energy momentum tensor with negative pressure we'll see how this causes the universe's expansion to accelerate outward in the next video so to summarize this video we learned about the energy momentum tensor for a perfect fluid whose components in the various forms look like this we also learned about the cosmic rest frame which is a frame of reference where no doppler shift is observed in the cmv radiation and where the average velocity of matter at large scales is zero this is the rest frame in which we measure the components of our perfect fluid energy momentum tensor for the einstein field equations it's also the frame where our scaling factor a of t from the flrw metric applies finally we talked about an equation of state for our perfect fluid we chose the simplest equation of state where the energy density is proportional to the pressure using a factor w w equals zero corresponds to dust-like matter w equals one-third corresponds to radiation and w equals negative one corresponds to a cosmological constant like term or dark energy in the next video we'll use everything we've learned so far to derive the friedman equations and look at the various types of universe evolutions they predict
