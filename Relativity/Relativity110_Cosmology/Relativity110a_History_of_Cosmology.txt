you may have heard before that the universe started with the big bang and that the universe is expanding these ideas come from the field of physics called cosmology which studies the origins of the universe and its evolution over time in the relativity 110 videos we're going to study what general relativity tells us about cosmology in this video i'm going to give a brief overview of the history of modern cosmology and how physicists came to believe in the big bang theory and the expansion of the universe and also talk about the cosmological constant and dark energy in later videos i'll get to the math of cosmology starting with the flrw metric which describes the geometry of an expanding universe then i'll derive the tensors related to the flrw metric then i'll talk about co-moving coordinates for an expanding universe and geodesics in the flrw metric then i'll talk about how we can model the universe as a perfect fluid and finally i'll derive the friedman equations which describe how things like mass density pressure and the cosmological constant affect the universe's rate of expansion and acceleration so before we get to the math i'm going to spend this video giving a history of modern cosmology according to general relativity and why we believe in things like the expansion of the universe and the big bang to start einstein published his original field equations for general relativity in 1915 in 1917 he published another paper on the cosmological considerations of general relativity and this is where he proposed adding an additional term to his field equations involving a constant lambda which was later named the cosmological constant in this 1917 paper einstein's main concern is the idea of an infinite universe full of matter that goes on forever and how this causes problems for general relativity and even newtonian gravity as well he is also concerned with ensuring the universe is static and not expanding or contracting over time einstein's solution to these problems involves adding the cosmological constant to his field equations so let's try to understand why he did this newtonian gravity is described by poisson's equation which tells us that mass density rho creates a dip in the gravitational potential phi which causes other nearby mass to be pulled toward it when considering a single planet or star it is usually assumed that the potential approaches zero as we get infinitely far from the mass einstein wonders how newtonian gravity would work if the universe was infinitely large where the density of matter in the universe is approximately uniform everywhere while the mass in our solar system is obviously not uniformly distributed if we zoom out to the scale of galaxy clusters that form galaxy filaments we can pretend the universe approximately has constant mass density everywhere in his paper einstein points out that newtonian gravity has trouble handling an infinite universe with a uniform mass density since all points in the universe are basically equivalent the gravitational potential phi should be constant but according to poisson's equation a constant potential would paradoxically mean that the mass density is zero this is not the first time someone has criticized newtonian gravity for how it handles an infinite universe seliger made similar criticisms in his seliger paradox einstein loosely suggested that adding an additional term to poisson's equation involving a constant lambda times the potential could fix this problem of newtonian gravity handling a constant mass density in an infinite universe since in the case of a constant potential this extra term still allows us to have a non-zero mass density so under this version of poisson's equation the uniform potential throughout the universe would be proportional to the universe's uniform average mass density individual stars and planets would then cause dips relative to this base level uniform potential later in the paper einstein considers this same problem for general relativity remember the einstein field equations are basically a generalization of poisson's equation where the laplacian of the potential is replaced by the einstein tensor and the mass density rho is replaced by the energy momentum tensor in general relativity when considering a single star or black hole we generally assume that space-time is curved near the mass but when we move infinitely far away we assume space-time becomes flat described by the minkowski metric but what if we once again zoom out and consider the case of a universe that has a constant mass density everywhere how should space-time curve in this case if it is assumed that space-time must become flat out at infinity einstein raises some objections i'm going to be honest and say that i don't really understand his objections he raises some problems with the concept of inertia and some statistical arguments that i don't understand instead of going through these i'm going to try and raise my own objection with a space time that becomes flat out at infinity that's easier to understand and more in line with what we saw with poisson's equation if we assume space-time must become flat out at infinity and also assume the space-time metric is static on the whole and unchanging over time since all points in the universe are on equal footing this implies that the universe must be flat everywhere for all time which implies that there is no mass according to the original unaltered einstein field equations anyway regardless of the exact argument used einstein finds that there are problems deciding what the curvature of space-time looks like in an infinite universe with uniform mass density einstein avoids this problem of considering space times curvature out at infinity by suggesting that the spatial universe is not actually infinite like a plane instead einstein proposes that the universe is spatially finite and more like a sphere so that if you go far enough in any one direction you end up back where you started we say that this is a universe with positive spatial curvature as opposed to a spatially flat universe which has zero spatial curvature after some calculations einstein realized that this model of a spherical universe was not static and could expand or contract over time and after doing some math he deduces that he can force the universe to remain static if he includes this constant lambda term in the einstein field equations similar to what he proposed earlier for poisson's equation this constant lambda was later called the cosmological constant and it is determined by the average mass density of the universe the cosmological constant also determines the spatial curvature of the spherical universe that einstein imagined so einstein proposed that overall the spatial universe was spherical and individual stars and planets would cause smaller more localized changes in the curvature of space-time he also assumed that this universe was static and not expanding or contracting over time einstein believed that adding this additional term to his equations was acceptable because it did not violate any laws of conservation of energy or momentum einstein also assumed that this constant was extremely small so that it would have basically no impact on most other applications of general relativity such as the orbits around massive bodies or gravitational waves the tiny lambda constant would only matter when considering the entire universe for cosmological purposes so by the end of his 1917 paper einstein has concluded that the spatial part of the universe is positively curved and as a result requires that a new term be added to the einstein field equations to ensure that the universe is static einstein admits towards the end of the paper that he isn't considering if his theory of the universe lines up with the latest astronomical knowledge but his theory lines up with general relativity just fine the next major step in cosmology based on general relativity came in 1922 when a soviet russian physicist named alexander friedman published his two friedman equations which described the evolution of the universe over time according to general relativity i'm going to give a short overview of the friedman equations from a more modern point of view this won't be the exact same as what you see in friedman's 1922 paper but it's the same general idea and the reasoning will be more straightforward than in his paper the basic assumption behind the friedman equations is that at the largest scales the universe is basically the same at all spatial points so similar to einstein we'll assume that at the largest scales the universe has a uniform mass density everywhere we're also going to assume that the universe has a uniform pressure everywhere treating the mass and energy in the universe like a fluid we're also going to allow for the spatial scale of the universe to change over time with a time-varying scale factor a of t which is applied to the spatial part of the metric we can make this assumption because although all spatial points in the universe appear to be on equal footing at large scales at this point we have no strong evidence to assume that the universe is the same over long periods of time in general relativity this time varying scale factor is now what we mean when we say that the universe is expanding so to get the friedman equations we use the assumption that the universe has a time-varying scale factor and that the universe has uniform mass density and pressure across space when we put these two assumptions into the einstein field equations we can derive two equations the first equation determined the expansion rate a dot of the universe and the second equation determined the expansion's acceleration a double dot for the universe you can see that these rates a dot and a double dot are determined by the universe's mass density rho pressure p the cosmological constant lambda as well as the spatial curvature k according to the friedman equations an expanding universe does not mean that we are creating new bits of universe and adding them onto the existing universe instead when this scale factor a of t grows over time it's as if the fabric of space itself is stretching increasing the distance between free particles some popular physics sources compare the expansion of the universe to blowing up a balloon if we draw a bunch of dots on the balloon then blow it up all the points will move away from each other as the balloon expands we're not adding more balloon material here it's just that the fabric of the balloon material is being stretched causing points on the balloon to separate this is exactly how the expansion of the universe works in general relativity now the two friedman equations were purely theoretical results that came from the einstein field equations in theory they did allow for an expanding universe if the expansion rate a dot was positive they could even allow for a universe that expanded and then shrunk again depending on how the numbers worked out but they could also theoretically allow for a static universe with positive curvature like the one einstein imagined if the expansion rate a dot and acceleration a double dot were set to zero for all time if the assumption about the universe having basically uniform mass density and pressure at the largest scales was true this would require a non-zero cosmological constant and a positive spatial curvature as einstein suggested upon reading friedman's paper einstein wrote up a short objection to it stating that the concept of a non-static universe was suspect to him and he tried backing this up with a calculation however einstein retracted his objection when he realized his calculation had an error and he admitted that the einstein field equations allow for a non-static universe the next advances in cosmology came from actual astronomical evidence that the universe was indeed expanding the empirical evidence involves redshift of light from distant galaxies here's a quick review of redshift and the doppler effect if we have a stationary source that's emitting waves in all directions the waves on all sides of the source will have the same wavelength but if the source is moving the wave fronts in front of the source will bunch up giving them a higher frequency and the wave fronts lagging behind the source will spread out giving them a lower frequency in the case of light waves blue light has a higher frequency and red light has a lower frequency so light sources moving toward you will have their wavelength shifted towards the blue end of the spectrum and light sources moving away from you will have their wavelength shifted towards the red end of the spectrum when we say light from distant galaxies is redshifted we're saying that the light from the galaxies is more red than we expect but why would we expect the light from distant galaxies to have any specific color at all this is where atomic spectroscopy comes in inside an atom we know that electrons exist around an atom's nucleus on only very specific orbitals when an electron drops from a high energy orbital to a low energy orbital the energy difference is released as light at a very specific frequency and this frequency exactly corresponds to the energy given up by the electron as given by planck's relation the bomber series of spectral lines shows the frequencies that hydrogen emits when an electron drops to a lower energy level at frequencies that are visible to humans the characteristic purple glow of a hydrogen lamp comes from the combination of these four wavelengths every element in the periodic table will have its own specific atomic emission spectrum these atomic spectra basically act as fingerprints that help us identify specific elements conversely when an atom absorbs light they can only absorb light at the very specific frequencies that correspond to an electron jumping from a lower energy orbital to a higher energy orbital this means that atoms can only absorb light at the same wavelengths that they can emit light at so if light were to pass through a cloud of hydrogen gas it is possible that the hydrogen atoms will absorb the light at the exact frequencies it normally emits light at and this basically subtracts or filters out specific frequencies that were present in the original light source when we look at the light from our sun we see a number of specific frequencies have been filtered out from the visible spectrum these missing frequencies are called the fraunhofer lines the reason these frequencies are missing is that various elements in the sun's atmosphere absorbs the sun's light at specific frequencies before the light reaches earth so when we look at the light from other stars or even other galaxies it's expected that their light will be missing specific frequencies due to light absorption by the various elements present in the atmospheres of stars when these missing frequencies match up with known elements but are shifted slightly we can attribute this shift to either blueshift or redshift from the doppler effect the american astronomer vesto slifer was the first to observe that light from other galaxies appeared to be red-shifted he observed this in 1912 before einstein had completed his general theory of relativity in 1927 belgian astronomer jealous lemaitre built on einstein's paper and used the observation of galaxies being redshifted to propose that the universe was expanding if we consider what all the galaxies around us would look like in an expanding universe all the galaxies would be moving away from us over time and galaxies farther away from us would be moving away faster so the light from all these galaxies would be redshifted and the further away the galaxy the faster it moves relative to us and the larger the redshift also it's important to realize that this visualization does not imply we are the center of the universe from the point of view of any galaxy the other galaxies would appear to be moving away as well all spatial points in the universe are equivalent and the universe has no spatial center le metre maintained that a universe with constant positive spatial curvature was a valid solution to the einstein field equations as einstein said but he also concluded that the radius of the universe would increase without bound as time went on and this explained the redshift of galaxies he also derived a formula which said that the outward radial velocity of galaxies was proportional to their distance from the observer a fact which is now known as hubble's law a few years later in the early 1930s le metro proposed that in the distant past the universe would have expanded from an initial point called the primeval atom which is essentially the idea behind the big bang theory that the universe began as a point and has been expanding ever since at the time this theory did not have widespread acceptance among scientists american astronomer edwin hubble also examined the relationship between the radial velocities of galaxies and the redshift of their light also independently proposing a linear relationship between the galaxy's distance from earth and its velocity this law has since been called hubble's law with the time varying factor of proportionality h of t between the distance and velocity being called the hubble parameter although in recent years there has been an attempt to rename this as the hubble le metro law in recognition of le metro's work the hubble parameter ends up being the ratio of the universe expansion rate a dot and the universe scale factor a from the friedman equations hubble calculated that the present value of the hubble parameter sometimes called the hubble constant was around 500 kilometers per second per megaparsec although later more careful measurements say the present value of h is closer to 70 kilometers per second per megaparsec when einstein became aware of hubble's publication he abandoned the cosmological constant and accepted the idea of an expanding universe and while we don't have direct evidence for this physicist george gamov reported that einstein once said that the cosmological constant was his greatest blunder since the unaltered field equation without the cosmological constant could have predicted the expansion of the universe all on their own additional evidence for the big bang and the expansion of the universe came from the cosmic microwave background radiation or cmb radiation cmb radiation is low energy electromagnetic radiation that is left over from the early universe after the big bang and it exists everywhere in space throughout the universe and travels in all directions the existence of the cmb was predicted by physicist ralph alpher and robert herrmann in 1948 alpher published a paper theorizing about the formation of heavy elements in the early universe using the friedman equations he concluded that in order for heavy elements to form in the proportions that they did the early universe must have been dominated by radiation as opposed to being dominated by matter basically an early universe dominated by matter would have allowed for heavy elements to form in much greater quantities than we see today but if the early universe was dominated by high-energy radiation the large quantity of high-energy photons would knock electrons loose any time they became bound to a proton preventing any atoms from forming as the universe expanded over hundreds of thousands of years the wavelengths of this radiation would also get stretched causing it to become red-shifted to lower energies as this radiation lost energy over time due to the universe expanding it would have become too weak to knock electrons away from protons allowing atoms to begin forming we call this phase in the history of the universe where atoms begin to form recombination if the big bang theory was correct this radiation would still be around today although it would have a very large wavelength and a very low frequency due to the expansion of the universe which is a fact that would not be predicted by a static universe existing in a steady state the cmb radiation was detected by accident in 1964 by american physicist arno alan penzias and astronomer robert woodrow wilson using the holmdel horn antenna when aiming the antenna at empty space they found there was a near uniform noise signal the signal was spread over a collection of frequencies that matched up with the body radiation spectrum expected from a black body with a temperature of 2.725 kelvin blackbody radiation has a distribution of frequencies that results from a system that is in thermal equilibrium with its environment the early radiation dominated universe would have had photons all throughout space constantly colliding with matter particles statistically because of all these collisions all the photons electrons protons and other particles in the early universe should have been in a state of thermal equilibrium meaning the frequency distribution of radiation would match black body radiation since the universe is expanding over time photon wavelengths are increasing and losing energy so the universe is also cooling over time so the low temperature black body radiation permeating all regions of the universe in the present day detected by the holmdel horn antenna is exactly what we would expect to see if the early universe was originally smaller hotter and dominated by radiation this radiation is called the cosmic microwave background and it's strong evidence in favor of the big bang theory more measurements indicated that the cmb had a slightly higher frequency on one half of the sky and a slightly lower frequency on the other half of the sky this was caused by the doppler effect as a result of the earth traveling through an ocean of cmb radiation the relative blue shift and redshift of the cmb on opposite sides allows us to calculate our speed through the cmb by carefully subtracting this doppler shift effect and also subtracting the radiation from various stars we get this image which is the cmb measured in all directions around earth projected onto a flat oval shape the cmb is almost completely uniform but there are very small deviations in temperature from the average due to the evidence of other galaxies receding away from us and the cosmic microwave background radiation as well as their theoretical underpinnings in general relativity by the 1970s the big bang theory had reached widespread acceptance as the main theory of cosmology the last thing i'll talk about in the history of cosmology is the more recent discovery that the cosmological constant may be non-zero after all after hubble's publication on the redshift of galaxies it was generally accepted that the cosmological constant in einstein's field equations was zero but since the 1990s evidence has been collected which says that the universe's expansion is accelerating while there are multiple different theories for explaining this acceleration the most straightforward explanation is that the cosmological constant is actually a small but non-zero positive number in 1998 two independent teams of astrophysicists analyzed data from various supernovas occurring in different galaxies all at different distances from the earth these were all type 1a supernova which have a standard expected behavior and brightness so they could all be compared with one another the farther away a supernova occurs from earth the longer it will take for the supernova's light to reach earth this means that light from a supernova that's farther away is light that's from earlier in the universe's history by analyzing supernovas from several different distances we're essentially analyzing light from different times in the universe's history it was found that the speed of various galaxies traveling away from the milky way galaxy is actually increasing over time according to the friedman equations mass density and pressure on their own would result in a negative acceleration rate indicating that the universe's acceleration would be slowing down in order to get a positive acceleration this requires the additional positive cosmological constant term which overpowers the acceleration effects of mass density and pressure for this reason the cosmological constant is sometimes referred to as being like a negative pressure because it causes the universe's scale factor to accelerate outward instead of slowing it down the cosmological constant is also sometimes called dark energy it's often the case that the cosmological constant is written on the left side of the einstein field equations along with the curvature terms but in the trace reversed form of the einstein field equations the cosmological constant is written on the right side of the einstein field equations along with the energy momentum tensor so in the trace reversed form the cosmological constant can be interpreted as a source of energy which changes the geometry of space-time we call this type of energy dark energy because it does not appear to interact with light and so it's difficult to detect again there are different competing theories for explaining the acceleration of the universe's expansion and all of these explanations are collectively called dark energy but the cosmological constant is the simplest and most straightforward type of dark energy so to summarize the history of cosmology over the last 100 years einstein originally introduced the cosmological constant in his field equations to ensure that his spatially spherical finite universe was static and didn't expand or contract over time friedman took the new einstein field equations and derived the two friedman equations which showed how the universe's spatial scale could change over time the work of le metre and hubble on observing the redshift of distant galaxies gave good evidence that the universe was indeed expanding and the discovery of the cosmic microwave background radiation gave further evidence that the expanding universe and the big bang theories were correct finally based on observations of supernova from different periods in the universe's history we've determined that the universe's expansion is accelerating indicating the cosmological constant is small but positive in the next videos we'll get into the math of the flrw metric for an expanding universe and we'll later derive the friedman equations and see how they predict the expansion of the universe
