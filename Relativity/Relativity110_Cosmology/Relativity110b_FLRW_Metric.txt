in this video we're going to derive the friedman lumetre robertson walker metric also called the flrw metric for short this is the metric that describes the expansion of the universe over time which is used in the standard model of cosmology the flrw metric was discovered and developed independently by four different physicists and so the metric is named after all of them the flrw metric is actually three metrics combined into one depending on the value of k which is positive one for a closed universe zero for a flat universe and negative one for an open universe in later videos we'll use the flrw metric to derive the friedman equations which directly govern the rate of the universe's expansion based on mass density pressure curvature and the cosmological constant so our goal for this video is to derive a metric that describes the large-scale geometry of the entire universe and this will be the flrw metric this metric can be derived from one fundamental assumption about the nature of the universe this fundamental assumption is called the cosmological principle which has two parts the first assumption of the cosmological principle is that the universe is spatially homogeneous this means that the universe looks the same from all points in space you can think of this as meaning that the universe doesn't appear to change when we translate our location from one spatial point to another this also means that the universe has no spatial center since all spatial points are equivalent the second assumption of the cosmological principle is that the universe is spatially isotropic and this means that the universe looks the same in all spatial directions you can think of this as meaning that the universe doesn't appear to change when we rotate our frame of reference now you might say that these two assumptions are obviously false after all our solar system has the burning hot sun a few planets many asteroids and lots of empty space depending on where you look so it's obviously not the same at all locations and in all directions but when we say the universe is homogeneous and isotropic we're talking about the universe on average at the largest scales if we zoom out from our solar system we'll see our galaxy then galaxy clusters and super clusters and then the web-like galaxy filaments at these huge scales we can divide the universe into boxes that are hundreds of millions of light years wide and at this large scale most boxes look basically the same so when we make the assumption that the cosmological principle is true we're assuming that the universe looks the same at all points and in all directions on average at the largest scales i said earlier that the flrw metric covers three metrics in one these match up with the three possible spatially homogeneous and isotropic universes which are the closed flat and open universes now from a mathematical point of view there are actually other geometries that are spatially homogeneous and isotropic such as a flat geometry that wraps around at the edges and makes a torus shape however in this video i'm going to ignore the more complicated geometries that have holes in them so i'm only going to consider the simply connected geometries without holes and in this case there are only three possible options to start let's focus on the familiar flat space case first the metric for flat space time is called the minkowski metric we know that in cartesian coordinates the flat minkowski metric looks like this and we're using the mostly minus convention here if we describe flat space time in spherical coordinates instead the minkowski metric looks like this let's think about how the minkowski metric would change if we assume that the cosmological principle is true and the universe looks the same at all points in all directions at the largest scales well notice that the cosmological principle says that the universe is spatially homogeneous and spatially isotropic it doesn't say that the universe is the same over time so according to the cosmological principle we can allow the scale of space to change over time we do this by scaling space by a factor a of t that depends on time this has the effect of multiplying the three by three spatial portion of the metric by a of t squared since the spatial metric components are the dot product of two spatial basis vectors and we're forced to multiply all the components in the spatial part of the metric by the same factor because we need to treat all directions as equivalent since the universe is spatially isotropic so this metric describes a flat space whose scale changes over time according to the scale factor a of t taken as a whole this four by four metric represents a curved space time described by a non-zero riemann curvature tensor but when we look at the three by three spatial part of the metric at a given instant of time this three by three metric represents a flat space with a spatial riemann curvature tensor that equals zero so even if the individual spatial slices in this metric are flat space-time as a whole is curved provided that a of t is not constant so a flat 3d space whose scale is changing over time with a scaling function a of t is one possibility for a universe that's spatially homogeneous and isotropic but that's not the only option there are two other choices for spatially homogeneous and isotropic universes which are the closed universe also called the spherical universe and the open universe which is also called the hyperbolic universe let's look at the case of a spherical universe first if we look at the familiar two-dimensional spherical surface all points on the sphere are basically equivalent and they are basically the same in all directions so just like the flat plane the sphere also meets the criteria of being spatially homogeneous and isotropic but our universe is spatially three-dimensional not two-dimensional so how would we describe a three-dimensional sphere mathematically well we know that the equation of a circle sometimes called the one-dimensional sphere in the x-y plane is given by x-squared plus y-squared equals r-squared where capital r is the circle's radius we can also parameterize the circle by the parameter theta where x equals r times cosine theta and y equals r times sine theta if we plug x and y into this formula and factor out r squared we can use the trig identity cos squared plus sine squared equals one to find that this equals r squared so this parameterization involving theta satisfies our circle equation the equation of the two sphere in 3d space is x squared plus y squared plus z squared equals the radius squared we can parametrize the sphere in terms of theta and phi we can think of theta as selecting an x coordinate on the sphere and we can think of phi as tracing out a circle of radius r times sine theta at that specific x coordinate if we sub this parametrization into x squared plus y squared plus z squared we can factor out r squared factor sine squared and collapse this to a one and collapse this to a one to get r squared as expected so this parametrization satisfies the two-sphere equation now the equation of a three sphere in 4d space is x squared plus y squared plus z squared plus w squared equals the radius squared we can't really visualize this easily with a drawing but we can parametrize the three sphere in terms of three angle coordinates theta phi and chi to get these we can follow the pattern for the parametrizations for the one sphere and two sphere the first coordinate is r times cosine theta for the next coordinate we turn cosine into sine and add cosine phi on the end for the third coordinate we turn cosine into sine and add cosine chi on the end and for the fourth coordinate we turn cosine into sine we can confirm that this parametrization satisfies our three sphere equation by factoring out r squared and collapsing all the cosine squared plus sine squareds to ones we can use these formulas for a sphere in any dimension and we can always follow a similar pattern to get the parametrization for that dimension but our spatial universe is three-dimensional so we're just interested in the three sphere recall that the basis vectors for our coordinate system are just the partial derivatives with respect to the coordinate variables we can write these basis vectors in terms of the x y z w basis vectors using multi-variable chain rule and if we work through all these partial derivatives we get these formulas for the basis vectors now there are two different metrics we can use to analyze the geometry of the three sphere we could use the extrinsic xyz w metric of the surrounding four dimensional space and this is just the four by four identity matrix or chronicle delta since the xyz w basis is euclidean and orthonormal or we could use the intrinsic metric which only uses the angle parameters theta phi and chi where the metric components are the dot product of the theta phi chi basis vectors if you work through all these dot products the off-diagonal metric components go to zero and the diagonal metric components look like this so this is the intrinsic three by three metric of the three sphere if you take this metric and go through the process of calculating the richie scalar for the three sphere you'll find that it's a constant positive number everywhere six over r squared where r is the sphere's radius a constant richie scalar is exactly what we'd expect for a space that's homogeneous and isotropic now since the names for these three angle coordinate variables are arbitrary i'm just going to relabel them so that they look like this and now we see that the metric for the three sphere almost looks like our flat metric in spherical coordinates but with the r-coordinate replaced by sine of chi so we have a metric for a universe that is spatially flat and another metric for a universe that is spatially spherical the third type of metric that is spatially homogeneous and isotropic is the metric for hyperbolic space hyperbolic space is a little bit more difficult to visualize but i'll do what i can to show you what it looks like so the two sphere s2 is a space where every point looks like two frowns crossing each other if we're standing on the outside of the sphere or two smiles crossing each other if we're standing on the inside of the sphere the hyperbolic plane h2 is a space where every point looks like a frown and a smile crossing each other so in h2 each point looks like a saddle point when we look at a circle of a given circumference in flat space the area and the circumference of a circle are given to us by the standard flat space formulas on a sphere a circle with the same circumference has an area that's greater than what we'd see in flat space because the space bulges out and increases the surface area in the hyperbolic plane a circle with the same circumference has an area that's smaller than what we'd expect in flat space because the circumference wastes a lot of distance going up and down around the saddle point and it doesn't enclose as much area the equation for the two dimensional hyperbolic plane is x squared plus y squared minus q squared equals negative r squared alternatively we could multiply both sides of the equation by negative one to get q squared minus x squared minus y squared equals r squared this gives the equation of a two sheeted hyperboloid we can parametrize this surface with angles chi and theta where the hyperbolic cosine of chi selects the q coordinate of the surface and theta traces out a circle of radius r times sine h of chi in the x y plane now even though we can draw this hyperboloid surface this is not a true representation of the hyperbolic plane because the distance function for measuring distances on this hyperboloid are not euclidean distances because the metric signature has minus signs in it so we cannot accurately judge distances on this surface using our eyes because the metric we're using to measure distances is not euclidean the hyperbolic plane is usually visualized using projections of various kinds where the distances and sizes of objects are distorted this drawing by escher is one of the most common visualizations of the hyperbolic plane where each fish or triangle occupies the exact same area according to the hyperbolic metric even though it doesn't look like it to our eyes i've linked to another video in the description that does a really good job of helping visualize hyperbolic space with that said the chi theta parameterization can be substituted into our qxy formula for hyperbolic space after factoring out r squared and factoring sine h squared this goes to 1 and using the hyperbolic trig identity cos h squared minus sine h squared equals one this becomes negative r squared as expected now to get the formulas for hyperbolic three space we can just follow the pattern like we did before the first coordinate variable equals r times cos h of chi then we change cos h to sine h and add a cosine on the end then we change cosine 2 sine and add a cosine on the end then we turn cosine into sine if we plug this parameterization into our formula for hyperbolic three space after factoring and canceling we end up with negative r squared at the end so this parametrization works so no matter what the dimension of hyperbolic space we're looking at is we can always use the same pattern to find out the parameterization but for our purposes we're only interested in hyperbolic 3-space as before we can get the basis vectors for chi theta and phi by expanding them in terms of the qxyz basis vectors using multivariable chain rule and as before we can use the extrinsic 4x4 metric with qxyz to measure distances or we can use the intrinsic 3x3 metric with chi theta phi just like before the off-diagonal metric components go to zero but the diagonal components now look like this if you calculate the richie scalar for hyperbolic three space you'll find that it's a constant negative value everywhere negative 6 over r squared again a constant richie scalar everywhere is exactly what we'd expect for a space that's homogeneous and isotropic so this is what our metric looks like for hyperbolic three space it looks the exact same as the metric for the three sphere except the sine term is replaced with a hyperbolic sine so we now have three different metrics for the three possible homogeneous and isotropic spaces the spherical space also called closed because the space is finite the flat space and the hyperbolic space also called open because it goes out to infinity and for consistency i'm going to replace the flat spaces r variable with chi we can now insert these three by three spatial metrics into the spatial part of our four by four space-time metrics where the spatial parts are multiplied by the scaling factor a of t which is consistent with a spatially homogeneous and isotropic universe i'm also ignoring the capital r parameters for the spherical and hyperbolic geometries since that's a constant that can be absorbed into a of t which basically plays the same role of telling us how curved the space is these three metrics are basically the exact same except for the role of the chi coordinate the chi coordinate is sort of like a radial coordinate that points out from the origin of the coordinate system although chi doesn't measure the true distance from the origin for a closed universe chi is the circular angle measured outward from the origin and for an open universe chi is the hyperbolic angle measured outward from the origin it's also important to remember that since the scale of the universe is changing over time with the scale factor a of t the actual distance represented by one unit of chi is also changing over time mathematicians have actually come up with a trick to write down all three of these metrics using a single unified metric and this is done by introducing a parameter k which is either plus one zero or negative one we can do this by rewriting the chi terms as the variable r so for a closed universe r equals sine of chi for a flat universe r equals chi and for an open universe r equals hyperbolic sine of chi so what we're doing here is we're basically doing a change of variables where the ct theta and phi coordinates stay the same but the chi coordinate is rescaled to a new coordinate called r remember basis vectors are just the derivative operators with respect to coordinate variables so to convert between a chi basis vector and an r basis vector we use the chain rule conversion term dr by d chi if we look at this derivative for each of the three universes we get cosine of chi for a closed universe one for a flat universe and hyperbolic cosine of chi for an open universe in terms of the metric components grr equals er dot er and g kai chi equals e chi dot e chi so the conversion factor between them is the square of this derivative for the closed universe cosine of chi squared is just one minus sine of chi squared and since sine of chi is just r this is also equal to one minus r squared for a flat universe we just leave one squared as one for the open universe cos h of chi squared equals one plus sine h of chi squared but since sine h of chi is just r this becomes one plus r squared so we can rewrite all three of these conversion factors using the form one minus k r squared where k is plus one for a closed universe zero for a flat universe or negative one for an open universe so what we've learned is that to convert from the grr metric component to the g chi chi metric component we multiply by the square of this derivative which is one minus k r squared and going in the other direction from chi to r we divide by one minus kr squared so to change our metric from using the chi coordinate to using the r coordinate we divide the g chi component by 1 minus k r squared to turn it into the gr component then we replace the various chi functions with r as we've defined up here the resulting metric describes all three spatially homogeneous and isotropic universes with a spatial scale factor a of t that can change over time this is the flrw metric which can describe an expanding universe before the end of the video i'll say one more thing about this coordinate change from chi to r that we did which will hopefully make things more clear for the closed universe the chi theta phi coordinates are all circular angles used to identify a point on the three sphere these are called hyperspherical coordinates after defining r as sine of chi the r theta phi coordinates are called reduced circumference polar coordinates on the three sphere the chi coordinate is the angle from the north pole to a specific point we can think of this point as lying on the edge of a disc with a radius small r looking at this triangle we can see that r equals the sine of chi which is the definition we made earlier and this red disk containing the point has a circumference of 2 pi r similarly for the open universe chi is a hyperbolic angle and all the other coordinates are circular angles and we can define r as sine h of chi if we look at the hyperboloid sheet chi is the hyperbolic angle of a point measured from the vertical axis looking at this triangle we can see that the radius small r of the red disc is sine h of chi as we defined previously and the circumference of this disc is again two pi r so with the r-coordinate we're not measuring the true walking distance from the origin to a point in the curved space instead we're drawing a circle around the origin containing that point with a constant radius and we define r to be the radius of a flat disc containing this point r is called the reduced circumference coordinate because it's defined by taking a circumference around the origin and dividing it by 2 pi so again the r-coordinate is not the walking distance radius from the origin to a point in curved space instead r is the circumference of a circle containing that point reduced by a factor of 2 pi we actually saw something similar for the short shield coordinates in video 108 b where the r-coordinate is equal to a circle's circumference divided by 2 pi so the short shield r-coordinate is also a reduced circumference coordinate not a true radius so that's it for this video in the next video we'll compute the various tensors in the einstein field equations that come from the flrw metric and this will help us solve for the motion of free particles in an expanding universe
