in this video we're going to go through the computation of all the tensors related to the flrw metric in the last video we derived the flrw metric which is like three metrics in one for the three possible spatially homogeneous and isotropic universes these are universes where all spatial points look basically the same and all spatial directions look basically the same the three possible universe geometries are the closed universe the flat universe and the open universe provided that we're ignoring more complicated geometries that have holes in the flrw metric we can choose between the three geometries by selecting the parameter k to be positive one for a closed universe zero for a flat universe or negative one for an open universe in this video we're going to derive all the tensors and coefficients related to the flrw metric so that we can see how the universe will evolve according to the einstein field equations so this video is going to be very computation heavy and a bit boring but it's necessary for future videos where we will look at the motion of free particles in an expanding universe and derive the friedman equations before i start i'm just going to mention some notation when a tensor summation is written with greek letters this refers to a summation over all four space-time indices where the index zero is time ct and one two 3 are the spatial coordinates r theta phi if a tensor summation is written with latin or english letters this just refers to the three spatial indices only also even though the universe scaling factor a of t depends on time i'm just going to write it as a to save space the first derivative of a with respect to time will be written a dot and the second derivative of a with respect to time will be written as a double dot finally since all the spatial components in the metric are different factors multiplied by a squared i will sometimes write these spatial factors using lowercase gamma so the spatial metric components are a squared times the gamma components where the gamma components are defined here so let's start by calculating the inverse metric for the flrw metric getting the inverse metric is easy since the inverse of a diagonal metric involves just taking the reciprocal of all the diagonal elements so given the components of the metric and the inverse metric let's compute all the connection coefficients since our metric is diagonal we know that the two indices on this inverse metric must be the same so we can change the alpha indices to sigmas this is not a summation over sigma on g inverse this is just a repeated index the summation is with the lowered indices on all the g's inside the brackets let's start by calculating all the connection coefficients with a zero index up top for zero zero on the bottom these two terms inside the brackets cancel we're going to see a lot of cancelling inside these brackets in this video so i'm just going to do the canceling without saying anything out loud from now on we're left with a derivative of g 0 0 and since g 0 0 is constant it goes to 0. now let's look at the case where both lower indices are spatial indices that are repeated denoted by the index i metric components that have one space index and one time index are off the main diagonal and they go to zero for the flrw metric g inverse zero zero is positive one and the time derivative of negative gii is just the ct derivative of negative a squared times gamma i i since only a depends on time and not the remainder of the spatial metric components gamma i i the derivative of a squared becomes 2a times a chain rule term we can cancel the one half with the 2 and rewrite the time derivative of a as a dot to get this so given this formula and plugging in the three different values for gamma i i we get three connection coefficients where the lower indices are 1 1 2 2 and 3 3. in each case the negative signs cancel and we get three connection coefficients which start with a a dot over c and then have a second factor that's different depending on the spatial index it turns out that all the other connection coefficients with a zero index on top go to zero let's continue on with the connection coefficients that have a one on top for the case with zero zero on the bottom all the metric components are either off-diagonal or constant so this goes to zero for one one on the bottom these cancel and we get one half inverse g one one times the one derivative of g11 since the one index is r we get this times the r derivative of this since the scale factors a only depend on time we can take them out of the derivative and cancel a squared to take the r derivative of this we use power rule to give the denominator a power of 2 and then get a chain rule term of negative 2 k r the negatives cancel the one-half and two cancel and one power of one minus kr squared cancel so we get kr over one minus kr squared for two two on the bottom off diagonals cancel and we get the r derivative of g 2 2. we again cancel the a squareds since they only depend on time and the r derivative of r squared is just 2r canceling one half and 2 we get negative 1 minus kr squared times r for 3 3 on the bottom off diagonals go to 0 and g3 3 is the same thing as g2 but with sine squared on the end so we get the same coefficient but with sine squared on the end next we'll look at 0 1 on the bottom off diagonals go to 0 and after plugging in we get the time derivative of g one one the one minus k r squared factors cancel and the derivative acts on a squared to give two a a dot and cancelling we get one over c times a dot over a and since the lower indices of the connection coefficients are symmetric gamma one zero one equals gamma one one zero it turns out that all the other connection coefficients with a one on top go to 0. next let's look at the connection coefficients with 2 on top if we look at the cases with 0 0 1 1 and 2 2 on the bottom after setting the off diagonal terms to 0 we just get the theta derivative of expressions that don't involve theta so they all go to zero however with three three on the bottom the off diagonals go to zero and we get the theta derivative of a term that does involve sine theta squared after taking all the non-theta terms out they cancel with each other and the derivative of sine theta squared becomes two sine theta times cosine theta canceling one half and two we get that gamma 2 3 3 equals negative sine theta times cos theta for 0 2 on the bottom we remove the off diagonals and sub n we can take the r squared out of the time derivative and cancel it and the time derivative of a squared is 2 a a dot after more cancelling we get gamma 2 0 2 and gamma 2 to 0 is 1 over c times a dot over a for 1 2 on the bottom we get rid of the off diagonals sub n cancel take the derivative and get 1 over r and for 3 2 on the bottom we get 0. so these are all the non-zero connection coefficients with 2 on top all the others go to 0. finally we'll look at the connection coefficients with 3 on top if both lower indices are the same we end up with a phi derivative and since none of the metric components depend on phi all of these go to zero for zero three on the bottom we can plug in and see that we get a time derivative the factors that don't depend on time all cancel and the time derivative of a squared gives two a a dot more cancelling gives us one over c a dot over a for 1 3 on the bottom we plug in and all the terms not involving r cancel with each other we end up with 1 over r for 2 3 on the bottom all terms not involving theta cancel each other out and we end up with cos theta over sine theta which is equal to the cotangent of theta all the other coefficients with three on top go to zero so we've calculated all the non-zero connection coefficients for the flrw metric now that we have all the connection coefficients it's time to calculate the reache tensor components the reache tensor components are just the riemann tensor components where we sum the upper index with the lower middle index let's start with r zero zero thankfully two of the connection coefficients go to 0 right away we're left with a bunch of summations in the remaining terms for the first summation mu can be set to 1 2 or 3 to give non-zero terms since the mu equals zero term ends up going to zero for the second terms there are only a small number of coefficients with zero as the lower index so this expands to a set of three terms where we set both mu and beta to either equal one two or three now note that these are actually the same term repeated three times and these are also the same term repeated three times so i'll just write the terms once and put a multiplying factor of three out in front subbing everything in we can factor out one over c squared to the front then we'll take the time derivative of a dot times a to the negative one which is done with product rule the derivative of a dot becomes a double dot and the derivative of a to the negative one becomes a to the negative 2 with a negative 1 out in front times the chain rule term of a dot notice that these positive and negative terms cancel so we're left with r 0 0 equals negative 3 over c squared times a double dot over a now the 1 1 2 2 and 3 3 components of the richie tensor are all very similar to each other so i'm going to get the basic formulas for them involving the connection coefficients and then compare them and look for similarities so r11 is defined by this formula the non-zero terms in this summation are for mu equals zero and one and for this summation it's mu equals one two three this alpha goes over zero and one and this beta goes from zero to three these cancel and these terms are equivalent so i'll combine them and put a 2 in front this summation has mu equals 1 2 3 but all those terms are equal so i'll just write a single term with a three in front this term goes over mu equals one two three but the two and three terms are equivalent so i'll combine them together with a two in front this is mu equals one this is mu equals zero one this term has mu equals two and this term has mu equals three and these last two terms are equivalent so i'll write them once with a two in front this three cancels with these to give one and this cancels with this now if we look at this term this is the r derivative of one over r which is negative one over r squared and this term is one over r times one over r which is positive one over r squared so these terms cancel and we're left with this formula for r one one now r two two is defined here and these sums expand with mu 0 1 mu 3 alpha 0 1 and beta 0 1 2 3. this mu sum expands to 3 of the same term this mu sum expands to 1 2 3 but 2 and 3 are the same term so i'll put a factor of 2 here this mu must be 2 this mu must be 2 this mu expands to 0 1 and this mu must be 3. this 3 cancels with these to give a 1 and this 2 cancels with both of these so with this formula this term turns out to be cotangent of theta squared and this term is the theta derivative of cotangent of theta since cotangent is defined as cosine over sine we take the derivative using product rule and this ends up being negative one minus cotangent squared so between these two terms the cotangent squareds cancel and we're left with minus negative one which is positive one so this is the formula for r two two r three three is defined here this mu expands to 0 1 2 and this term goes to 0 since none of the terms depend on the third variable phi alpha expands to 0 1 2 and beta expands to 0 1 2 3. this mu expands to 3 terms that are all the same so i'll put a 3 in front and this mu expands over 1 2 3 but 2 and 3 are the same term so i'll put a 2 in front each of these muse are forced to be three and this mu expands to zero one two this three cancels down to a one this two cancels with these two and this cancels with this now the last term is negative cosine times sine multiplied by cotangent which is cosine over sine so this is just negative cosine squared and this is the theta derivative of negative cosine times sine pulling the negative sign out and using product rule we get sine squared minus cosine squared since these two terms have opposite sign the cosines cancel and we're left with sine squared so this is the formula for r33 so we have formulas for r11 r22 and r33 and immediately we see that the first terms in each case are zero derivatives of a coefficient with zero on top notice that all of these coefficients start with a a dot over c and then are followed by the spatial terms in the metric for r theta and phi which earlier we called the lower case gamma coefficients so the first terms each equal the time derivative of a a dot over c times the gamma ii for that index the second terms also have this a a dot over c gamma term but multiplied by a coefficient equal to a dot over a times 1 over c for this time derivative we can pull c and gamma out in front since they don't depend on time and using product rule we get a a double dot plus a dot squared and for this term we can cancel a's and simplify to a dot squared now if we sub in the formulas into this term here the r's cancel and we can rewrite the denominator as gamma 1 1 to get 2 k gamma 1 1 next notice that when we compare gamma 1 2 2 and gamma 1 3 3 the only difference is that gamma 1 3 3 has sine squared on the end so we can change gamma 1 3 3 into gamma 1 2 2 if we factor out a sine squared so now we just need to compute this expression subbing in we see this cancels with this and for this derivative we need to use product rule the derivative of this expression is positive two k r and this derivative goes to one so we just get one minus k r squared with a negative sign in front simplifying we can cancel all these terms on the end to get 2 kr squared and since r squared is lowercase gamma 2 2 we can rewrite this as 2k gamma 2 2. and with the extra sine squared on the end this is just gamma 3 3 so these terms on the end each equal 2k gamma i and i'll multiply and divide by c squared to make this consistent with the other terms so all the diagonal components of the richie tensor equal this term in front multiplied by the gamma ii term from the metric which gives these expressions here for i equals one two three and it turns out all the off-diagonal richie components go to zero so we'll ignore them so for the flrw metric we have the corresponding inverse metric and we have the corresponding richie tensor components which means we can calculate the richie scalar which is just the trace of the richie tensor where one of its indices is raised using the inverse metric if we plug all these terms in we'll leave the first term alone for the second term we'll cancel 1 minus kr squared from both terms for the third term we'll cancel r squared from both terms and for the fourth term we'll cancel r squared sine squared from both terms this means that the last three terms are all the same so i'll write out the term once with a multiplying factor of 3 in front now both remaining terms involve 1 over c squared a multiplying factor of 3 and a common denominator of a squared so we can just add all the numerators to give us two a a double dot and if we factor a two from all the terms we can change the three in front into a six and this gives us the richie scalar for the flrw metric you'll notice that this richie scalar value has a negative sign in front this is because we're using the mostly minus metric convention if you're using the mostly plus metric convention the richie scalar will be positive instead basically whatever sign convention you choose the term one-half times the richie scalar times the metric should end up having the same sign since multiplying the metric by negative one has the effect of multiplying the richie scalar by negative one as well and the negative signs just cancel so we have all the required tensors on the left hand side of the einstein field equations in the next few videos we'll use the connection coefficients to calculate the paths of free particles in an expanding universe and also plug these tensors into the einstein field equations to derive the friedman equations which determine how the spatial scale of the universe evolves over time
