in this video we're going to derive the einstein field equations which are the main equations of general relativity they predict the existence of black holes the expansion of the universe and gravitational waves we'll do this derivation by generalizing poisson's equation for newtonian gravity to the relativistic einstein field equations that are agreed on by all reference frames let's quickly review what we've learned so far in the last few videos in relativity 107 a and b we learned the equivalence principle which says that local gravitation is equivalent to acceleration and we showed that gravity is just the curvature of the manifold of space-time on large scales the manifold of space-time is curved but in small local regions it can be approximated by a flat tangent plane so in small local regions the laws of general relativity reduced to the laws of special relativity in relativity 107c we learned about the richie curvature tensor which is a 4x4 tensor that measures the curvature of space-time in 107d we learned newton-cartagh theory which was newtonian gravity reformulated using curved space-time described by the zero-zero component of the richie tensor and in 107e we learned about the energy momentum tensor which generalizes the mass density to a four by four tensor where the zero zero component is the energy density which is basically the mass density multiplied by the speed of light squared so how do we generalize poisson's equation to make it relativistic and true in all reference frames from newton carton theory we know that the laplacian of the gravitational potential is just the zero zero component of the richie tensor and the mass density is more or less the zero zero component of the energy momentum tensor but this equation alone is not relativistic because the mass density and the zero zero component of the richie tensor are not agreed on by all reference frames due to the effects of time dilation and length contraction one idea to fix this problem is to simply upgrade the reache and energy momentum components to the full 4x4 tensors and hope that this gives us a relativistic theory of gravity this is actually pretty close to the correct answer however it's not quite right einstein originally published a proposal of setting the reachy tensor to be proportional to the energy momentum tensor but he later realized this was not right and corrected himself in later publications the problem is related to the divergence of tensors which is when we take a covariant derivative of a tensor and do a summation with one of the indices since the tensors we're dealing with in this video are symmetric it doesn't actually matter which index we do the summation on also recall that we can raise an index of a tensor by doing a summation with the inverse metric or lower an index by doing estimation with the ordinary metric the problem is that the space-time divergence of the energy momentum tensor is zero we learned in relativity 107e that this is how we express the local conservation of energy momentum in space-time however the space-time divergence of the reached tensor is non-zero so there's no way this equation can be correct however it turns out that if we make a slight modification and subtract one-half times the richie scalar times the metric tensor then the divergence of the left-hand side of this equation is zero this special combination of the richie tensor richie scalar and metric tensor is called the einstein tensor denoted by a capital g this small modification basically gives us the correct einstein field equations however there's another small modification we can make notice that if the derivative of a function is zero then we can always add a constant to that function and its derivative will still be zero similarly if the divergence of the einstein tensor is zero we can always add a constant to it and the divergence will still be zero this constant is called the cosmological constant denoted by a capital lambda and it is related to the expansion of the universe a property called the metric compatibility property says that the covariant derivative of the metric tensor in any direction is zero so we can also include a metric tensor in our cosmological constant term finally if we take our einstein field equations and force them to match poisson's equation in the limiting case of weak gravity and low velocities we can show that this constant of proportionality kappa is 8 pi times newton's gravitational constant over the speed of light to the power of 4. so the einstein field equations basically tell us that mass energy and momentum on the right side of the equation directly causes space-time curvature described on the left side of the equation by the richie tensor richie scalar and metric tensor this proportionality constant is telling us how much space time curvature we get for a specific amount of mass energy momentum so this constant sort of measures the stiffness of space-time this constant ends up being really small which means it takes a huge amount of mass energy or momentum to cause a noticeable amount of space-time curvature so the rest of this video is basically going to be me proving all of the facts i just stated in detail first i'll show how we can get the cosmological constant term from the metric compatibility property then i'll prove that the divergence of the einstein tensor is zero which is called the contracted bianchi identity and finally i'll derive the constant of proportionality from the limiting case of a weak gravitational field at the end of the video i'll talk a bit about the sign conventions for the einstein field equations because some textbooks might have plus or minus signs in different places than me depending on the conventions they use let's start by proving that the divergence of the cosmological constant term is zero which involves the metric compatibility property previously in relativity 107c i said that the metric compatibility property of the covariant derivative means that we can take the covariant derivative of a dot product of vectors and apply a kind of product rule where we get a sum of two terms one with the covariant derivative applied to the first vector and the other with the covariant derivative applied to the second vector this basically means that we keep the angles and lengths of vectors constant during parallel transport along a path remember parallel transporting a vector means that the covariant derivative of that vector along a path is zero so if we are parallel transporting both v and w these terms will go to zero and so the metric compatibility property tells us that the derivative of v dot w along this path is zero so the angle between the vectors and the vector lengths are constant if we apply the metric compatibility property to basis vectors we get this expression we can rewrite these covariant derivatives of basis vectors using the definition of the connection coefficients and also note that the covariant derivative of a scalar number from this dot product is just the partial derivative we can then rewrite all these basis vector dot products as the components of the metric tensor so this is an alternative way of writing the metric compatibility property if we bring all the terms to one side it turns out that all of this equals the covariant derivative of the metric tensor which equals zero we sometimes write this statement like this without a direction in the covariant derivative since the covariant derivative of the metric is zero in all directions so let's prove that this is indeed the covariant derivative of the metric recall that to take the covariant derivative of a vector we write the vector as a linear combination of basis vectors then use product rule to take the derivative of the components and the basis vectors the covariant derivative of the components becomes the partial derivative since components are just ordinary numbers and the covariant derivative of basis vectors can be rewritten using the connection coefficients if we relabel this summation with a mu and factor out the basis vector we get an expression for the components of the covariant derivative of the vector v we can take the covariant derivative of the metric in the same way except we write the metric as a linear combination of two covectors combined using the tensor product we do this because the metric is a function that takes two vector inputs and so it's made of a linear combination of two covectors combined together using the tensor product we use product rule to take the derivative of the components and then the basis and we use product rule again to get the derivatives of each covector we can rewrite the covariant derivative of a covector using connection coefficients labeled with omega which are different than the gamma connection coefficients used for vectors after relabeling the summation indices to make the basis covector indices match and factoring them out we get this expression for the components of the covariant derivative of the metric we can solve for these omega connection coefficients by defining a covector alpha to be a function that takes the dot product with some vector a so alpha of e is the same thing as a dot v so if we take the metric compatibility property and apply it to the case of a dot v then we can replace some of the a dots with alpha for the left side of the equation we can expand alpha in terms of the epsilon basis covectors and expand v in terms of the e basis vectors then pull the v components out in front because co-vectors are linear epsilon acting on e gives us a chronicler delta by definition and since this is zero except for when the new and sigma indices match we can replace the news with sigmas in this summation for the right hand side of the equation we can also rewrite the covariant derivative of the covector alpha and the covariant derivative of the vector v in their expanded forms and since alpha is a covector and linear by definition we can pull all these coefficients out in front by definition the epsilon sigma covector acting on v gives us the sigma f component of v and the alpha covector acting on the e sigma basis vector gives us the sigmath component of alpha we can then distribute to get this now using product rule on the left side term gives us exactly what we see on the right side of the equation so these terms cancel with each other we can then relabel some of the indices here and we can factor the alpha and v components now this formula must be true for any arbitrary choice of covector alpha and vector v so the only possible conclusion is that the omega coefficients are the negative of the gamma coefficients so given that we know the omega connection coefficients are just the negative of the gamma connection coefficients we have proved that the metric compatibility property is the same thing as saying that the covariant derivative of the metric in any direction is zero and because of this we can feel free to include the metric times some constant in our einstein field equations because we know that this term goes to zero when we take its divergence just like the energy momentum tensor next we'll prove the contracted bianchi identity which says that the divergence of the einstein tensor is zero remember the einstein tensor is defined as the reachy tensor minus one half times the richie scalar times the metric tensor and we will show its divergence is zero to make the proof easier to read i'm going to switch notations and write the covariant derivative direction after a semicolon instead of using the nablus symbol so the statement we want to prove now looks like this before we start the proof i'm going to quickly review the symmetries of the riemann tensor swapping the third and fourth indices gives us the same component but with a negative sign in front swapping the first and second indices also gives us a negative sign swapping the first two and last two indices as pairs gives us the exact same component and if we cycle the last three indices and add all the components together we get zero this last property is called the bianchi identity also recall that summing over the top and lower middle index of the riemann tensor gives us the richie tensor which is symmetric and summing over the upper and lower index of the richie tensor gives us the richie scalar we're going to start with the first bianchi identity which means these three components with lower indices cycled around sum to zero we'll use this to prove the second bianchi identity which is a similar formula but also involves a covariant derivative index finally we'll use this to prove the contracted bianchi identity proving the second bianchi identity in general is a bit challenging so we're going to prove it in the simpler case of local inertial coordinates where the connection coefficients are zero at a given point the second bianchi identity can be expressed as an abstract tensor equation without reference to any basis or coordinate systems so if we can prove it to be true in one coordinate system then it must be true in all coordinate systems if you want to see the full general coordinate proof of this fact you can check out my tensor calculus 26 video which is linked in the description so when we take the covariant derivative of the riemann tensor we're really taking the covariant derivative of the riemann components multiplied by the tensor product of four sets of basis vectors and that gives us five terms one for the component derivative one positive connection term for the basis vector and three negative connection terms for the three e basis covectors all of this is equal to the riemann covariant derivative components and remember the riemann components are given by this ugly formula involving the connection coefficients which means this formula is very very complicated to make life easier we're going to use a special coordinate system called the riemann normal coordinates at a point p also called the local inertial frame this is an orthonormal coordinate system so the metric components are equal to the minkowski metric components and also the connection coefficients are all zero this means that in this coordinate system all these connection terms go to zero we can't yet send the other coefficients to zero because they are derivatives of the connection coefficients and these could still be non-zero if we sub the riemann component formula into here and distribute the alpha derivative we can use product rule on these terms and since the result contains connection coefficients without the derivatives they go to zero so we have a formula for the riemann covariant derivative components at our chosen point p in local inertial coordinates now i can take these three terms from the second bianchi identity and write them out using this formula and i'll color code the matching terms remember the order of partial derivatives doesn't matter so we are free to interchange them if we want if i sum all these terms together the blue terms cancel the red terms cancel and the green terms cancel so this proves the second bianchi identity in local inertial coordinates and again since this is a tensor result it should extend to all coordinate systems now let's continue on to proving the contracted bianchi identity we'll start with the second bianchi identity and sum it with two inverse metric tensors if we distribute this row mu inverse metric can raise the row index on these first two components and for now we'll just let it sit next to the third term now you might wonder if we can raise an index on the covariant derivative of tensor components and the answer is yes if we take the covariant derivative of the metric acting on the riemann tensor we can use product rule to get a sum of two terms and by metric compatibility the term with the derivative of the metric is zero this means that when we have the derivative of an expression with the metric the metric compatibility property lets us slide the metric outside the derivative so since we can take the covariant derivative after or before applying the metric we can raise indices after taking covariant derivatives without any problems now we can swap the third and fourth indices of these components if we flip the sign to negative and also flip the first and second indices on these components if we flip the sign to negative since we're summing the upper index with the lower middle index we can rewrite these as reachy tensor components we can then use this sigma new inverse metric to raise all these sigma indices and then rewrite this summation as a reachy tensor then use this inverse metric to raise its row index we can rewrite this summation on this richie tensor as the richie scalar and also relabel this new index summation with mu we can then combine these terms with a negative two coefficient and then multiply the equation by one half i can also change this lower alpha index to mu if i sum with a chronicler delta this is just like multiplying by the identity matrix and it doesn't change the meaning of the formula finally we can sum with a new alpha inverse metric to raise this alpha index and use the index cancellation property of the chronicle delta to relabel this alpha index as mu we can also swap the inverse metric indices since the inverse metric tensor is symmetric this statement is actually equivalent to the contracted bianchi identity remember metric compatibility tells us that the covariant derivative of the metric is zero so we can just pull it outside of the covariant derivative and then just apply the covariant derivatives to the richie scalar and the richie tensor this proves the contracted bianchi identity that the divergence of this term goes to zero since this corrected version of the richie tensor called the einstein tensor has zero divergence we can feel comfortable using it on the other side of an equation using the divergenceless energy momentum tensor to complete our derivation of the einstein field equations we need to prove that this constant of proportionality kappa is equal to 8 pi times newton's gravitational constant over the speed of light to the fourth power we'll do this by assuming the einstein field equations reduced to poisson's equation in the limit of low velocity weak gravity and assuming the space-time metric doesn't depend on time for the low velocity limit this means that the mass of objects which are the source of gravity will travel much slower than the speed of light so their beta coefficient is basically zero their gamma coefficient is basically one and there is basically no time dilation so coordinate time t equals proper time the four velocity vector of massive objects will be dominated by the time component c and the other components go to zero the weak gravity limit means our metric is going to be the minkowski metric eta which is a diagonal matrix of plus one minus one minus one minus one plus a small change h where the size of the components of h are much smaller than one to clarify what this weak gravity limit really means when we're doing summations with a metric we'll take the h part to be very small so the metric is basically flat but when taking metric derivatives the minkowski part goes to zero since it's constant and only the derivative of the h part matters finally time independence means that in our coordinates the metric components don't depend on time so their derivative with respect to time goes to zero as a consequence the time derivative of the connection coefficients also goes to zero we're also going to assume that the cosmological constant term is small enough to be ignored we're going to assume that basically all gravity is caused by mass so we'll use a dust like energy momentum tensor that describes stationary matter this is given by the rest mass density rho times the outer product of two four velocity vectors so basically the t zero zero component is rho times c squared and all other components are zero in the weak field limit we can also lower these indices using the minkowski metric and show that t 0 0 with lower indices is also equal to rho c squared knowing this we can find out a lot about what the richie tensor and richie scalar look like from the einstein field equations if we look at the three by three spatial components of this equation we know that the spatial energy momentum tensor components go to zero and the spatial part of the minkowski metric is just a negative three by three identity matrix so this tells us that the three by three spatial part of the richie tensor is a chronic delta or identity matrix multiplied by negative one-half times the richie scalar and recall the richie scalar is just the trace of the richie tensor which is the richie tensor with one of its indices raised using the metric this gives us r00 minus r one one minus r two two minus r three three as we showed the diagonal spatial parts of the richie tensor are all each equal to negative one half times the richie scalar so we can combine them to be three times negative one-half r canceling these minus signs we get plus three over two times r and solving for r zero zero we also get negative one-half r so the full reachy tensor is just the four by four identity matrix times negative one half r so in matrix form our einstein field equations currently look like this these spatial components cancel and we're left with a single one component equation the negative richie scalar equals kappa rho c squared and from here we know that the negative richie scalar is also equal to two times the component r00 we can use the low velocity limit to solve for the connection coefficients and then solve for r 0 0. recall from relativity 107d that we can rewrite the gravitational force equation like this using the gravitational potential phi we can force this to match the geodesic equation to solve for some of the connection coefficients if we use the proper time tau as the path parameter then these derivatives become the four velocity components using our low velocity limit we can replace the proper time tau with the coordinate time t and only include the time components of u in this summation which both equals c if we set the upper index to zero then this second derivative would go to zero forcing the zero zero zero connection coefficient to go to zero as well so we only include the spatial upper index in this equation if we force this equation to match our acceleration due to gravity equation we get that the k00 connection coefficients are the partial derivative of phi divided by c squared it's worth noting that the other connection coefficients aren't necessarily zero here but we don't need to bother solving for them either so we're just going to ignore them we can use these connection coefficients to determine the r00 component which is equal to this summation over the riemann tensor we only need to worry about the spatial components in this sum since the time components go to zero due to the anti-symmetry property of the last two indices in the riemann tensor using our formula for the riemann tensor these components equal this and using our time-independent metric condition the time derivative of this connection coefficient goes to zero it's also possible to show that in the weak gravity limit the connection coefficients are very small so we'll assume that the product of connection coefficients is extremely small and can be neglected and if we sub these connection coefficients in we get that the r0 component is the laplacian of the potential over c squared so if we sub r0 into our previous formula we get this and if we assume poisson's equation is valid in our limit we can replace the laplacian of the potential with 4 pi g rho we can cancel the rows and solve for kappa to get 8 pi g over c to the fourth power this is the constant that's required to make the einstein field equations reduced to newtonian gravity in the limit of low velocities and weak gravity and this completes our derivation of the einstein field equations there is an alternative way of writing the einstein field equations called the trace reversed form we get this by summing each term with an inverse metric this will raise the richie and energy momentum tensor indices and when the inverse metric is summed with the ordinary metric we get the chronic delta because the inverse metric cancels with the ordinary metric after summation this is just like how we multiply a matrix by its inverse to get the identity matrix the trace of the richie tensor is the richie scalar r and we'll denote the trace of the energy momentum tensor with a capital t and the trace of the chronicle deltas is just the number four since the trace of the four by four identity matrix is just the number four multiplying one half by four gives us two and solving for r we get negative four lambda minus kappa t we can now sub this in for the richie scalar in our original einstein field equations multiplying out the negative one half and bringing all these terms to the other side we get this alternate form of the einstein field equations called the trace reversed form which looks very similar to the original version but contains the trace of the energy momentum tensor instead of the trace of the richie tensor it's also possible to solve for kappa using this form of the einstein field equations if desired finally i'm going to comment on the sign conventions for the einstein field equations and the extra minus signs that can pop up depending on the sign convention you use the wikipedia article on the einstein field equations has a helpful guide on the sign conventions that i'm going to refer to the most obvious sign convention issue is the sign convention for the minkowski metric which the wikipedia article calls the s1 sign in my videos i've been using the mostly minus convention but there's also the mostly plus convention obtained by multiplying the metric components by negative 1. let's take a look at how flipping the sign of the metric will impact the einstein field equations the first thing to notice is that if we change the sign of our metric then we must also change the sign of the inverse metric so that we can guarantee that the metric summed with the inverse metric gives us an ordinary identity matrix with positive one along the diagonal next we'll notice that the connection coefficients are defined using a summation of the inverse metric with several metric terms if we flip the sign of the metric terms then we must also flip the sign of the inverse metric and this gives us the product of two minus signs in several places in the equation the product of two minus signs is just a plus sign it ends up being the case that the formula for the connection coefficients is completely unchanged when we flip the sign of the metric since the riemann tensor is defined completely in terms of the connection coefficients its sign doesn't change either and neither will the richie tensor which is just the trace of the riemann tensor however the richie scalar involves raising an index of the richie tensor using exactly one metric so flipping the sign of the metric will flip the sign of the richie scalar however the einstein field equation term involving the ricci scalar also involves the metric so the metric sign change and the richie scalar sign change will cancel each other out and the overall sign of this term does not change a similar argument can be made for the term involving the trace of the energy momentum tensor in the trace reversed form finally the cosmological constant term involves exactly one metric tensor and that's it so flipping the sign of the metric will change the sign of the cosmological constant term so after all that what i'm trying to say is if we have the einstein field equations and flip the sign of the metric the only term in the einstein field equations that will change sign is the cosmological constant term so wikipedia says that the s1 sign is the sign in front of the mostly pluses metric and in the sign convention i'm showing the cosmological constant term should have the same sign as the metric in this video i'm using the mostly minuses metric so my s1 sign is negative this means that my cosmological constant term will also have a negative sign now there are two other important sign conventions to make note of i've defined the riemann tensor and reachy tensor like this but some authors might flip these terms effectively changing the sign of the riemann tensor they may also define the richie tensor using a summation of the upper index and the last lower index and this also introduces a minus sign due to the anti-symmetry property of the last two indices of the riemann tensor i'm going to call the sign in front of the riemann tensor formula s2 and the sign in front of the richie tensor formula s a so in the einstein field equations changing either of these signs will flip the sign of both the richie tensor and the richie scalar so i'm going to put s2 times sa in front of both the richie tensor and scalar terms alternatively if we remember the definition of the einstein tensor we can just put s2 times sa in front of the einstein tensor so we have our three sine conventions s1 s2 and sa and this is how they affect the signs in the einstein field equations in this video i use minus 4s1 and plus 4s2 and sa so my field equations look like this this paper by einstein actually uses a different sign convention than me so you can see there's an extra minus sign here that i don't have you'll notice my sign notation is slightly different from wikipedia's notation which uses s3 instead of sa what i call sa wikipedia calls s2 times s3 the wikipedia convention ignores the cosmological constant term here so in my opinion their sign convention notation is incomplete i'm pretty sure the cosmological constant term would get an s1 times s3 sine to make things consistent so to sum up this video we started with poisson's equation for newtonian gravity which is not compatible with special or general relativity because the mass density can change for each observer due to the effects of length contraction we upgraded the mass density to the relativistically invariant energy momentum tensor and upgraded the laplacian of the potential to the relativistically invariant rigi tensor this was close to the correct equation but it wasn't quite correct because the right side of the equation has zero divergence and the left side of the equation has non-zero divergence we use the contracted bianchi identity to prove that this modified version of the richie tensor called the einstein tensor g has zero divergence which makes it a suitable left hand side of our field equations also the metric compatibility property tells us that the covariant derivative of the metric tensor in any direction is 0 so we can also include a term with the metric in our equation where this constant lambda is called the cosmological constant we finally showed that this constant kappa must be 8 pi g over c to the 4. if we want the equation to match poisson's equation in the limit of low velocities and weak gravity now that we've derived the einstein field equations in the next few sets of videos we will use them to understand gravitational waves black holes gravitational time dilation and the expansion of the universe as well as other effects predicted by general relativity
