in the relativity 107 videos we're going to talk about the basics of general relativity in this video we're going to talk about the equivalence principle then in future videos we'll talk about manifolds and the curvature of space-time then newton-carton theory which is a theory of newtonian gravity involving curved space-time then the energy momentum tensor and finally the einstein field equations in this video we're going to build a bridge from special relativity to general relativity we'll start with special relativity which uses flat space time then we'll state the equivalence principle which will make us realize that gravity is different than the other kinds of forces then we'll see that we need the curvature of space-time to describe gravity specifically to describe tidal forces and then this will lead us to the need for general relativity so as we covered in relativity 104 and 105 special relativity is the theory of relativity that we get when we assume that the speed of light in a vacuum c is constant in all inertial frames special relativity ignores gravity and uses flat space time general relativity expands upon special relativity by including the equivalence principle which roughly says that local gravitation is the same thing as acceleration general relativity does take gravity into account and uses curved space time so the length that helps us make the jump from special relativity to general relativity is the equivalence principle technically speaking there are several different versions of the equivalence principle but to start i'm just going to use a simplified version the equivalence principle says that in small regions of space time you cannot tell the difference between upward acceleration and downward gravity so if we have a box sitting on the surface of the earth and another box that's in deep space that's accelerating upward a ball placed at the box's ceiling will fall to the floor in both cases in the case of deep space an observer floating in space will just see a ball floating stationary beside them over time but because the box is accelerating upward the floor of the box will eventually crash into the ball if we look at this situation from the perspective of someone standing inside the box it looks like the ball is being pulled to the floor by a force just like we'd see standing on earth when a ball is pulled down due to gravity the reason for this similarity between accelerated frames and gravity is that newton's second law f equals m a and newton's law of gravity both say that the force acting on an object is proportional to the object's mass in f equals m a we could say that m means inertial mass and in newton's law of gravity we could say that m means gravitational mass there's no reason why these two types of mass should be related but every experiment we've ever performed shows that the inertial mass and gravitational mass are equal to each other so if we set f equals m a equal to the gravitational force the inertial mass cancels with the gravitational mass and we find that an object's acceleration due to gravity is actually independent of its mass it only depends on the mass of the source of the gravity so all objects will accelerate towards earth at the same rate if we ignore air resistance the acceleration is independent of an object's size shape and mass similarly when a rocket is in deep space and accelerates upward if a row of objects are arranged at the same height the floor of the rocket will collide with the objects at the exact same time the size shape and mass of the objects do not play a role in when this collision happens as long as the bottom of the objects are at the same height this is not the case with other forces like electrostatic forces where the force felt by an object depends on its electrical charge q and so an object's acceleration due to electrical forces depends on both its charge and its mass so the equivalence principle tells us that accelerated or non-inertial frames of reference are indistinguishable from a frame standing on the ground in a uniform gravitational field all experiments that we do in both cases will turn out the exact same such as watching a ball released from the ceiling dropped to the floor this is provided that the acceleration of the rocket and the acceleration due to gravity are the same value in meters per second squared now there's also a flip side to the equivalence principle it also says that non-accelerating inertial frames of reference are locally indistinguishable from frames of reference that are freely falling in a gravitational field this means that a ball in a box that are floating inertially in deep space are indistinguishable from a ball in a box that is free-falling down towards earth if we are standing on the earth watching a ball in a box fall together towards the ground the ball will always stay in the center of the box throughout its journey remember acceleration due to gravity in a uniform gravitational field is independent of an object's mass and shape so the ball and the box have equal acceleration towards the earth meanwhile an observer inside the box that is falling along with the box would just see the ball floating in the center of the box they will be completely unaware of any gravitational field that is until they collide with the ground but before that point it will be as if they are in an inertial frame with no forces acting on them or the ball so the equivalence principle tells us that any experiments we do in an accelerating frame in deep space will be indistinguishable from experiments that we do standing on the earth's surface in a uniform gravitational field but the equivalence principle also tells us that experiments that we do in an inertial frame in deep space are indistinguishable from experiments that we do in a frame that is in free fall also i'll talk more about this in later videos but the equivalence principle also implies that light beams will bend under the influence of gravity if a light beam is released inside an accelerating container like this it will reach the other side closer to the floor due to the box's acceleration an equivalent effect must be seen for a stationary box on a gravitational mass so gravity does cause light beams to bend now that we've stated the equivalence principle let's see how gravity is different from the other forces to do this we're going to have to turn the equivalence principle into real mathematics so that we can do calculations that involve both gravity and relativity and to do this we'll introduce the concept of proper acceleration which is measured by an accelerometer if you're inside a car and the driver steps down hard on the gas pedal causing acceleration you will feel as if you're being pulled towards the back of the car this feeling of being pulled backwards is your body feeling proper acceleration so proper acceleration alpha is the acceleration measured by an observer in their own reference frame relative to an inertial reference frame and proper acceleration is measured with an accelerometer an accelerometer is made of a rigid outer box with an inner ball that is electrically and magnetically neutral the ball is balanced on springs that are attached to the outer rigid box the spring compression is what helps us measure alpha the larger the spring compression the larger the proper acceleration felt by the accelerometer throughout this video series i've used terms like constant velocity and acceleration it's important to remember that technically speaking these terms are relative and depend on the reference frame that we're in i could say that when we step hard on the gas pedal our car is accelerating with respect to the ground but i could also say that the car is stationary with respect to the driver so concepts like constant velocity and acceleration are relative and they will depend on who you ask talking about constant velocity and acceleration on their own without a reference point does not make any sense however an inertial observer will always measure zero proper acceleration on an accelerometer that they are carrying with them by definition similarly a non-inertial observer will always measure a non-zero proper acceleration on an accelerometer they're carrying with them the concepts of inertial and non-inertial frames are objective and can be agreed upon by all reference frames and all observers this is because an observer's proper acceleration alpha is an objective number that is agreed upon by all reference frames if your personal accelerometer measures 10 meters per second squared then everyone in the universe will also agree your accelerometer measures 10 meters per second squared this means that the number alpha is an invariant quantity or a tensor because everyone in the universe agrees on it now let's see how an accelerometer measures proper acceleration in some examples let's say that we're in deep space and there is a rope that is attached to an accelerometer if the rope pulls the accelerometer forward with constant force then the outer rigid box will get pulled forward but the inner ball will lag behind until it is pushed forward by the spring this results in the spring compressing since one of the springs is compressed the accelerometer measures a non-zero proper acceleration alpha because the ball pushes up against the spring the accelerometer can tell it is now in a non-inertial reference frame caused by the force of the rope pulling on it now if we have an accelerometer where the outer box is made of iron it will get pulled toward this magnet now remember the inner ball of an accelerometer is always electrically and magnetically neutral so it will not feel attracted towards the magnet once again the outer box will get pulled forward but the inner ball will lag behind causing spring compression so once again non-zero proper acceleration is measured if the outer box has a rocket attached to it which applies a force as the box gets forced forward the inner ball will again lag behind causing spring compression and so we measure a non-zero alpha now what about the case of an accelerometer moving in free fall towards the earth since both the outer box and the inner ball will have the same acceleration relative to the earth's center this means that the inner ball will travel with the exact same motion as the outer box meaning there is no spring compression and therefore proper acceleration alpha is measured to be zero we can see here that gravity is different than other forces in nature that we've seen because gravity acts on both the outer box and the inner ball equally so when an accelerometer is in free fall it measures a proper acceleration of zero just like we'd expect for inertial frames so we've seen that gravity is not like other forces when an accelerometer is in free fall due to gravity it measures zero proper acceleration just like we'd expect in the case of an accelerometer in deep space traveling in an inertial frame with no forces acting on it because free fall does not result in any proper acceleration we're going to make an important change to our thinking in physics and say that gravity is not a force at all instead we're going to say that free fall is just the natural motion of all objects so normally newton's first law tells us that in an inertial frame an object with no net external forces on it will remain at a constant velocity we're going to modify newton's first law for general relativity so that it says an object with no net external forces on it will travel along a special curve called a geodesic i'm not going to go into all the details of geodesics in this video i already talked about them in relativity 105 f and i'll talk about them more in coming videos but a time like geodesic basically gives the path in space time of a massive particle that is in free fall and has zero proper acceleration and these are the paths that particles will take in general relativity when no forces are acting on them this law basically means that free fall is the natural state of objects and we need a net external force to change a particle's trajectory away from a free-fall geodesic the net external force will cause a particle to experience a non-zero proper acceleration and change paths away from a geodesic a more technical way of saying this is that a four force is required to cause for acceleration which changes an object's world line away from a geodesic in space time so an object in free fall will travel along geodesics this includes an object that is dropped out of a plane falling towards the earth but it also includes the international space station orbiting around the earth the international space station is not literally falling towards the earth in the sense that it is not getting closer to the ground but it is still considered to be in free fall because it is only influenced by gravity and no other forces in standard newtonian mechanics if an object is sitting on the earth we would say that it has no net external forces on it because the downward force of gravity balances exactly with the upward normal force of the ground but in general relativity gravity is not a force the natural free fall motion of a particle from only gravity would cause the particle to keep falling towards the center of the earth but the surface of the earth is stopping the object from continuing its free-fall motion due to molecular forces which force the object upward if an accelerometer box was sitting on the earth the ball would sink down and compress the spring because of its own weight indicating proper acceleration that's non-zero this non-zero proper acceleration indicates something is forcing the box away from an inertial frame the ground is forcing the box upward away from its geodesic free-fall path so sitting on the earth's surface has a lot more in common with being in a non-inertial reference frame where a force is acting on the box in both cases proper acceleration alpha is non-zero and the observer feels pulled in one direction also while massive objects travel along time-like geodesics when no forces act on them beams of light will travel along light-like geodesics also called null geodesics whose shape are influenced by gravity which is the curvature of space-time i'll talk about these more in later videos so we understand that gravity is not like the other forces because it doesn't result in any proper acceleration now let's see how gravity causes tidal forces and why this means we must require space time to be curved if it is going to handle gravity now throughout this video i've been using phrases like small or local regions of space-time and uniform gravitational field the equivalence principle which says that inertial motion is indistinguishable from free fall only applies in these uniform gravitational fields or small regions of space-time we know from newton's law that gravitational fields are not uniform we know that gravity far away from the earth is weaker than gravity closer to the earth because according to newton the gravitational force is inversely proportional to the radius squared so in larger regions of space time it turns out that we can tell the difference between a globally inertial frame and free fall let's say that we have a long horizontal room and we place two balls inside at opposite ends in deep space far away from any sources of gravity these balls would simply float in place at opposite ends of the room but if this room is in free fall towards earth gravity will not pull these balls directly downward instead the balls will be pulled towards the center of the earth meaning they will gradually move slightly toward each other so in large enough regions of space-time that is if we have a large enough room and wait enough time objects that are following natural free-fall motion at the same height will gradually move toward each other also in a tall room with two balls at opposite ends if the room is in deep space the balls will remain stationary with respect to each other but in free fall towards earth the balls will start to move apart vertically since gravity acts more strongly on the lower ball so if we stop thinking in terms of relativity and just think in terms of standard newtonian physics if we place a ball above the earth the center of the ball will be attracted straight downwards towards the earth's center but different parts of the ball will be attracted to the earth in slightly different ways the sides of the ball will be attracted inward somewhat and the bottom of the ball will experience a stronger attraction to the earth and the top of the ball will experience weaker attraction if we compare these force vectors to the force vector at the center of the ball and take the difference we see that the effect of gravity is to squish the sides of the ball together and to pull the top and bottom of the ball apart in newtonian physics we call this squatching and stretching effect due to non-uniform gravitational fields tidal forces although in general relativity there is no actual force and this is just the natural motion of objects in free-fall the gravitational tidal forces from the moon on the earth are what cause sea levels to rise and fall the water at the top and bottom of the axis of gravitation is being pulled apart and the water at the sides is being squished together note that the water on the far side of the earth is not being repelled from the moon it just isn't being pulled towards the moon as strongly so why do tidal forces matter tidal forces are a big problem in special relativity because they cannot be described by any reference frame in flat space time we know that in the reference frame of a box moving with constant proper acceleration it's possible to make all inertial objects in the universe look like they are accelerating backwards with constant acceleration however with tidal forces it's possible to end up in situations where it looks like forces are being applied in opposite directions and there is simply no way to explain this using flat space time and special relativity to fix this problem we need to invent a new version of relativity that can handle tidal forces this new version of relativity is called general relativity and it is able to describe tidal forces by using curved space time the next couple videos will go over the mathematics needed to describe curved space time which involves understanding manifolds and the riemann curvature tensor after that we will move on to describing newtonian gravity with curved space-time and then continue on to describing general relativity's version of gravity with curved space time so to summarize this video we said that an observer's proper acceleration alpha is a quantity that is agreed upon by all reference frames alpha is measured using an accelerometer in an observer's own reference frame where an accelerometer is made out of an outer rigid box and an inner ball connected by springs we learned about the equivalence principle which says that inertial motion is locally indistinguishable from free-fall motion under the influence of gravity both result in zero proper acceleration also non-inertial motion due to a force is locally indistinguishable from standing on a mass that generates a gravitational field both result in non-zero proper acceleration measured on the accelerometer we said that space-time world lines with zero proper acceleration are called geodesics and all free fall motion due to gravity without any other net forces are along these geodesics any deviation away from geodesic world lines requires net external forces that result in a non-zero proper acceleration finally we learned that all real sources of gravity are non-uniform and result in tidal forces which are impossible to explain using flat space time and special relativity we need to upgrade to the curved spacetime of general relativity to explain tidal forces and gravity now one last thing i said earlier in this video that there are several different versions of the equivalence principle the weak equivalence principle says that gravitational mass is equivalent to inertial mass meaning all objects fall at the same rate the einstein equivalence principle says that in a small region of space-time there is no experiment you can do to determine if you are in an accelerating box or standing on the surface of a gravitational mass provided we ignore internal gravitational forces between our experiment objects the strong equivalence principle says that in small regions of space-time there is no experiment you can do to determine if you are in an accelerating box or standing on the surface of a gravitational mass and this includes gravitational forces between our experiment objects now i'm not going to bother worrying about the differences between these three formulations of the equivalence principle i've put some links in the description to places where you can learn more about them if you're curious but from now on we're just going to assume the strong equivalence principle which says there's absolutely no way to tell the difference between an accelerating frame and standing on a gravitational mass in a small region of space-time and the strong equivalence principle includes the other two inside of it
