in this video we're going to cover the energy momentum tensor which is the main object on the right-hand side of the einstein field equations and acts as the source of curvature in space-time in the last video i talked about how we can take poisson's equation from newtonian gravity and reformulate it in terms of space-time curvature setting the zero-zero component of the richie tensor to be proportional to the mass density however this equation won't work for general relativity because neither are 0 0 nor the mass density are invariant in all reference frames if we have a mass m in a volume v at rest then the mass density is rho if we look at this same setup in a frame where the volume is moving the volume could be length contracted to be half its size meaning the mass density in the moving frame will double in size so the mass density depends on the frame of the observer it turns out that we can generalize the mass density to a tensor called the energy momentum tensor which is agreed on by all reference frames in special and general relativity the energy momentum tensor tracks the flux of energy and momentum through space-time this can be confusing to understand at first so we're going to work up to it in small steps i'm going to spend about 10 minutes covering a simpler related concept called the number flux 4 vector n starting in galilean relativity and then again in special relativity i'll also talk about how the number flux 4 vector can be used to describe a conservation law for the number of particles in space time next we'll cover the full energy momentum tensor and in a similar way we'll see how we can use it to describe conservation laws of energy and momentum in space-time finally we'll talk about the energy momentum tensors for dust like and perfect fluid distributions of matter so this video is a bit long but my goal is to give you a good intuition for the energy momentum tensor instead of just throwing equations at you to begin we're going to consider the number flux vector in galilean relativity without any length contraction effects we'll consider special relativity and length contraction later so the number flux 4 vector has four components the time component gives the number density for a group of particles and the spatial components give the current densities for the three spatial directions i'll explain what this means using pictures to calculate a density over space in one dimension this is just a quantity per unit length for example charge density in one dimension is the amount of charge per unit length mass density is the amount of mass per unit length and number density is the number of something per unit length so if we have four particles in a unit length then the number density would be four another important concept is one dimensional current which is the amount of something passing through a point in a unit time for example electric charge current is the amount of charge that passes this point per second mass current is the amount of mass crossing this point per second and number current is the count of objects passing this point per second now it seems like density and current are two separate concepts but they're actually related we can visualize both number density and number current on a space-time diagram let's say that we have a collection of stationary particles their world lines would all be vertical like this to get their one-dimensional density in space we pick some constant time t and count the number of particles in a unit length delta x this is the same thing as drawing a line segment of length one at a constant time and counting how many particle world lines cross it so if four world lines cross this line segment then the number density is four particles per unit length now let's say that we have a collection of particles moving to the right with constant speed to find their current in the x direction we need to know how many particles are passing through a point in one unit of time we can calculate this by picking a constant position x and counting the number of world lines that cross a line segment for a unit time delta t the particles attached to each of these world lines corresponds to particles that have crossed this exact point during one unit of time so if two world lines cross this line segment this means that the number current in the x direction is two particles per unit time now let's look at the case where we have two spatial dimensions x and y as well as time on a space-time diagram a bunch of stationary particles would have vertical world lines like this to get their two-dimensional number density we just count the number of particles in a two-dimensional unit square in the x-y plane at some constant time this is the same thing as drawing a square at a constant time in the x y plane and counting how many world lines pass through it so if we have four world lines crossing this square then we have a 2d density of four particles per unit area now if we have a bunch of particles moving in the x direction we can find their x current density this is the number of particles crossing a unit length per second we can get the x current density by taking a unit area in the time y plane at some constant x value and counting how many world lines pass through it basically the y direction of the square is our unit length that we're counting the current density in and the time direction of the plane is the unit time that we're using to measure the rate of flow so counting the number of world lines that cross this plane will give us the x current density the number of particles crossing this line per unit length in a unit of time if we wanted to measure the current density in the y direction instead we would just count the world lines crossing a unit square in the time x plane instead at some constant y value now if we go to full 4d spacetime with time and all three spatial dimensions xyz we unfortunately can't visualize the paths of particles easily on a spacetime diagram the 3d number density would be the number of particles inside an xyz unit cube at some constant time on a four-dimensional space-time diagram this would be the number of world lines that cross a 3d xyz unit cube at some constant time but again we can't easily draw this on paper the number current density in the x direction is the number of particles that cross a unit square in the yz plane in a unit of time this would be the number of world lines that cross a three-dimensional time yz unit cube where the yz gives us the unit square for measuring the current density and the time length of the cube gives us the unit time that we're measuring the current over the y number density would involve counting world lines in the time x z unit cube and the z number current density would involve counting world lines in a time x y unit cube but again these are not easily drawn so at first glance it seems like the three possible number current densities in the xyz directions are fundamentally different than the number density we measure over 3d space at some constant time but geometrically these four concepts are all just different versions of the same thing for spatial number density we just count the number of particles per unit xyz cube at a constant time for x number current density we count the number of particles per time yz unit cube and for y and z number current densities we count the number of particles per time x z unit cube and time x y unit cube all four of these quantities are measured by counting the number of particles in a 3d box in space time and they make up the four components of the four vector that we call the number flux 4 vector for the purposes of this video the word flux means the same thing as current density different areas of physics might define the word flux a little bit differently but for this video the word flux just means the number of world lines that cross a unit box in a space-time diagram or in other words it's the number of particles inside a box when we hold one of the space-time coordinates constant now let's say that we have a bunch of particle world lines and we draw a box in space-time if we have five world lines that enter this space-time box then we must also have five world lines that leave this space-time box this is because particles don't get created or destroyed and world lines can't just spontaneously start or stop the mathematical version of this statement is that the four-dimensional divergence of the number flux for vector is zero given by this formula here this is what we call a continuity equation because it relates the density of particles over time and the spatial divergence of the particle current density basically if particles are leaving a spatial xyz box with positive divergence the density of particles in the box must decrease over time and if particles are entering an xyz box with negative divergence the particle density must increase over time a more compact way of writing the continuity equation using the einstein summation notation is like this to introduce some new notation we sometimes denote the density in the rest frame of the particles as a lowercase n this is called the rest number density in galilean relativity this is the same thing as the ordinary number density in all frames but we'll see later in special relativity number density can change depending on the frame now you'll notice that for the x number current density also called the x number flux we can multiply and divide by delta x this lets us rewrite the term as the spatial density or the time flux times the velocity of the particles in the x direction we can do something similar for the y and z directions so this is an alternative way of writing the number flux for vector so we can rewrite the components of the number flux 4 vector in terms of the rest number density small n and the particle velocities but we know that the velocities of objects are relative and depend on the reference frame if we have some stationary particles and a car moving to the right both the stationary frame and the car reference frame will measure the same number density of particles four because their x basis vectors are the same and lengths don't change in galilean relativity but while the stationary frame measures a current of zero the moving car measures a current of two so in galilean relativity current measurements depend on the reference frame but density measurements are the same for everyone if we upgrade to special relativity which uses lorentz transformations instead of galilean transformations we have to deal with length contraction which does make the number density different in different reference frames so when the stationary frame measures a number density of 4 here the moving frame measures the number density along a diagonal line of constant c t tilde using a unit length of delta x tilde which results in a higher number density of around 5. specifically the number density in the rest frame is increased by multiplication by the gamma factor for the moving frame the gamma factor takes length contraction into account so that there are more particles per unit of space we can also measure the x current density at a line of constant x tilde and this ends up being about three although the exact numerical value is the galilean result of two multiplied by the gamma factor which takes time dilation into account so we can see how to get the components of the number flux 4 vector using pictures but we can also get the components using algebra in galilean relativity we know that the 4 position vector s looks like this with the four components being t x y z and the number flux vector looks like this with the number density multiplied by a vector of one and the three spatial velocities in special relativity the four position vector s looks the same except we multiply time by the speed of light c to make the units consistent for all four components for the number flux vector we also multiply the time component by c to make the units consistent to take the effects of time dilation and length contraction into account we need to multiply each of these components by the gamma factor we can see now that the number flux 4 vector in special relativity is just the number density of particles in the rest frame multiplied by the four velocity of the particles so the full 4 vector looks like this now the density of particles in their own rest frame small n is agreed on by all frames of reference this means that if we know how to transform the components of the four velocity in different frames then we also know how to transform the components of the number flux 4 vector because the rest number density doesn't change so we transform the number flux 4 vector just by using the standard lorentz transformation matrix that we've seen all throughout this video series with the number flux 4 vector we're counting the total particles which is a single number inside a box of size 1. because of this the number flux 4 vector is enough to describe the flow of particles in all four space-time directions but what if we wanted to count the total 4-momentum which is a vector quantity inside a box of size 1. another 4-vector is not enough to describe the flow of four momentum inside a box instead we're going to need a four by four tensor called the energy momentum tensor which describes the flow of the four components of four momentum in all four space-time directions so to get the 4x4 energy momentum tensor we're going to use the same strategy of counting particles in a box that we used for the number flux 4 vector except this time we're going to be counting 4 momentum inside of a box instead of just the number of particles inside the box we can find the components of the energy momentum tensor as follows the t alpha beta component is equal to the flux of alpha momentum going through a unit box at a coordinate of constant beta this probably sounds pretty abstract so let's look at some examples let's go back to our 2d space-time diagram for time and x with particles moving in the positive x-direction each of these particles has their own four-momentum vector that they are carrying with them let's look at the one-dimensional four-momentum density which is the amount of four-momentum at a constant time ct per unit length delta x so inside this unit length at constant time all of these four momentum vectors have a time component and an x component if we look at the total of the time components this gives us the time time component of the energy momentum tensor this is the total time momentum crossing a boundary of constant time we can also look at the total x momentum in this unit length this gives us the x time component of the energy momentum tensor which is the total x momentum crossing a boundary of constant time we can also look at the total momentum contained in the x flux of particles which is just the particles that pass through some point at a constant x value in one unit of time which is represented by a vertical line segment the total time components of these four momentum vectors gives us the time x component of the energy momentum tensor the total time momentum crossing a boundary of constant x and the total x components of the four momentum vectors gives us the x x component of the energy momentum tensor the total x momentum crossing a boundary of constant x it turns out that the energy momentum tensor is symmetric so t alpha beta equals t beta alpha we can see this in our space-time diagram geometrically the amount of x-momentum coming out of this surface of constant time the x-t component is equal to the amount of time momentum coming out of this surface of constant x the t x component we can generalize this approach to four dimensional space time by looking at the amount of four momentum flux through a three-dimensional unit space-time box instead if we take an xyz box of unit volume at some constant time then we would be looking at the alpha time components of the tensor since time is constant now let's look at the four momentum vectors of the particles living inside this volume we can count up the total time momentum x momentum y momentum and z momentum these give the t t x t y t and z t components of the energy momentum tensor we could also take a unit box made of time y and z with a constant x component to examine the flux of four momentum in the x direction this would be the alpha x components of the energy momentum tensor since the x coordinate is held constant we look inside the box and calculate the total time x y and z momentum this gives us the tx xx yx and zx components of the energy momentum tensor we can use a unit time x z box at constant y to get the alpha y components and a unit time x y box at a constant z to get the alpha z components of the energy momentum tensor so these 16 components give us the full description of how four momentum is moving through space-time a bunch of particles moving through space-time will each have their own world line the result is like a river of 4-momentum which looks a little bit like spaghetti if we take a cross-section of this spaghetti using a unit box at a constant coordinate then the total for momentum in this box will give us four of the 16 components of the energy momentum tensor so the energy momentum tensor t is like a machine that takes two unit vectors as input and outputs a momentum density t acting on v and w gives us the total momentum in the v direction inside a unit 3d space-time box perpendicular to the w vector the t alpha beta component is just what we get when the momentum direction is a basis vector e alpha and the 3d space-time box is denoted by a perpendicular basis vector e beta so we can think of the alpha beta components of the energy momentum tensor as the flux of alpha momentum crossing a unit volume of constant beta but we should remember that the time component of four momentum is the energy of a particle so the first row of the energy momentum tensor where alpha is the time index is really about the energy of the particles also the phrase flux across a volume of constant time is really just a fancy way of saying the word density across space which is the amount of stuff in an xyz unit box at a constant time so the first column where the beta is the time index is really about densities across space so we can also interpret the components of the energy momentum tensor as follows the time time component is the energy density and the rest of the first row is the flux of energy in the different spatial directions the rest of the first column is the density of spatial momentum at a constant time and the remaining nine components are the flux of spatial momentum in the three spatial directions the three diagonal elements are called pressure where momentum is perpendicular to the surface that it's crossing pressure has the tendency to squash and stretch objects we say that these are equal to pressure because they're equal to momentum divided by time over a unit square and since momentum divided by time is just force this is force over a unit square which is the definition of pressure the off-diagonal components are called the shear stress where the momentum is parallel to the surface it's crossing these have the tendency to shear or rotate objects it turns out that we can express the laws of conservation of energy momentum by taking derivatives of the energy momentum tensor for now let's pretend we're working in special relativity in standard cartesian coordinates so that we don't have to worry about the connection coefficients in our derivatives let's take the components in the top row of the energy momentum tensor these tell us the flux of the time component of momentum or energy through various boxes in each coordinate direction now let's take the divergence of these components so we differentiate the four components by time x y and z respectively then add them all together if we view the time and space portions of the equation separately it kind of looks like a continuity equation where if the energy is flowing out of a box then the energy density must decrease over time or if the energy is flowing into the box then the energy density must increase over time to make this continuity equation make sense we must set this expression equal to zero so that energy can never be created or destroyed it can only flow in and out which results in changes to the energy density so when we say that the divergence of the first row of the energy momentum tensor is zero we are basically demanding that energy be conserved we can also take the divergence of the next row and force it to be zero as well this gives us a continuity equation for x momentum which forces the x momentum to be conserved basically if x momentum is flowing out of a time y z box then the x momentum density must be decreasing and if x momentum is flowing into a time y z box then the x momentum density must be increasing setting the divergence of the last two rows of the energy momentum tensor to zero gives us continuity equations for y and z momentum which forces y and z momentum to be conserved we can rewrite the four equations of conservation of energy and momentum more compactly using four einstein summations where we sum the derivative index with the second index of the energy momentum tensor we can then summarize all four equations as a single summation where we allow the first index mu of the energy momentum tensor to be any of the four space-time indices you might see this summation written in this notation which looks similar to taking the divergence of a vector only this time we're taking the divergence of a tensor this notation is a bit strange but it just means that we treat each row of the tensor as a vector and take the divergence of each one giving us four divergence equations also i said earlier that i used a simplifying assumption of a coordinate system where the connection coefficients are zero if we want a law of conservation of four momentum that works in all coordinate systems we must use a correct covariant derivative and take the derivative of the basis vectors as well this derivative has two summations with connection coefficients because the energy momentum tensor is a rank two tensor the components of this derivative are summed using this notation with the nabla symbol or this notation with the semicolon symbol instead of the partial derivative only this is the proper law of conservation of four momentum that works in all coordinate systems now it should be noted that in general relativity this conservation of energy momentum equation only applies locally at an infinitesimal point in large regions of space-time there is generally no law of conservation of energy momentum for example in an expanding universe the wavelengths of photons expand along with space red shifting them to lower energies energy is simply lost in this case and is not conserved i'm not going to get into the mathematical reasons for why energy momentum is not conserved in curved spaces in this video but it's related to there being no sensible way to add four momentum vectors in a large region of space-time because parallel transporting them to the same tangent space will depend on your choice of parallel transport path before this video ends i'm going to give two quick examples of real energy momentum tensors the dust and perfect fluid energy momentum tensors a dust-like distribution of matter is a collection of particles that are not exerting pressure on each other let's say that we know each particle has 4 momentum p and their densities are described by a number flux for vector n if we want to know how much 4 momentum is located inside a unit xyz cube at some constant time we just multiply p by the number particle density which is the time component of n since p is the four momentum of each particle and nt is the number of particles in a unit xyz box then p times nt will give us the total for momentum inside the unit xyz box which are the alpha t components of the energy momentum tensor if we want to know what the four momentum flux in the x direction is this is the four momentum contained in some unit time y z cube at a constant x and we get this by multiplying the four momentum p by the x flux which is the x component of n so basically if we want to know the flux of four momentum in the beta direction we just multiply the four momentum vector by the beta component of the number flux four vector which gives us the beta column of the energy momentum tensor in terms of arrays the dust energy momentum tensor is the outer product of the 4 momentum and the number flux 4 vector using more abstract tensor language the energy momentum tensor for dust is just the tensor product of the 4 momentum and the number flux 4 vector this helps explain why the energy momentum tensor is rank 2 and needs two transformation matrices one for each index when we change coordinates one matrix changes the components of the momentum vector and the other matrix changes the space time orientation of the unit box we use to compute momentum density the energy momentum tensor itself is invariant and agreed on by all coordinate systems but the components we get will depend on the basis vectors used to measure the momentum densities for the dust energy momentum tensor we can also rewrite the four momentum as the rest mass m times the four velocity vector and the number flux four vector can be rewritten as the rest number density n times the four velocity and we get this matrix times the rest mass density rho which is the rest mass times the rest number density in the case of stationary dust where the spatial components of the four velocity are zero the dust energy momentum tensor only has one component the energy density which is the mass density rho times c squared this is sort of like e equals m c squared per unit volume now not all energy momentum tensors are dust like where we can write it as a tensor product of four momentum and the number flux four vector for example if the particles exert equal pressure on each other in all directions then the x x y y and z z components of the energy momentum tensor will be equal to a pressure p this is the energy momentum tensor for a perfect fluid where the particles are stationary in space but exert constant pressure on each other there are many other types of energy momentum tensors that i won't get into in this video so to summarize this video we wanted to generalize the concept of mass density to something that's invariant under lorenz transformations and doesn't change even with the effects of time dilation and length contraction we started with the concept of number flux 4 vector the time component counts the number of particles in a spatial cube at a moment in time and the three spatial components count the number of particles crossing a unit square over a unit time which is kind of like a unit cube with two space dimensions and one time dimension so the concept of spatial density and current density are all unified as one idea counting the number of particles in a 3d box in 4d space time we then generalized this idea of counting particle flux across a 3d unit cube to counting the amount of four momentum contained in a 3d unit cube which gave us 4 times 4 equals 16 components since for each of the four cubes we could draw in space time we could count one of the four components of four momentum this symmetric four by four matrix is called the energy momentum tensor and it is the correct generalization of mass density for special and general relativity we also found we could write a law of conservation of for momentum by saying the divergence of this tensor is zero now that we've generalized the mass density to the energy momentum tensor in the next video we're going to generalize poisson's equation to the einstein field equations which are the main equations for our relativistic theory of gravity called general relativity
