in this video i'm going to talk about how we measure the curvature of space-time mathematically the three tools that we use to measure curvature on romanian and pseudo-romanian manifolds are the riemann curvature tensor the richie curvature tensor and the richie curvature scaler the einstein field equations which are the main equations in general relativity contain the richie tensor and the richie scalar so it's important to understand both of them the reachy tensor is also used in the curved space-time description of newtonian gravity which is called newton-carta theory which i'll talk about in the next video in this video i'm first going to introduce these tensors then at the end of the video i'll show that the rindler metric used in the rindler coordinate system for an accelerating observer in special relativity describes flat space time because all the components of the riemann curvature tensor are zero we'll see actual curved space times with a non-zero riemann tensor in future videos and just as a warning this video is going to cover a lot of content in a very short amount of time if you feel lost after watching this video you can check the description for links to my videos from my tensor calculus series where i discuss curvature more slowly so it's easier to follow along the video you're watching right now is basically a quick summary of these other videos remember we are going to think of derivative operators as actual vectors and we might write the basis vectors using any of these three notations all of these mean the same thing these are all derivative operators that are also basis vectors before the idea of riemannian manifolds was invented mathematicians like gauss studied the differential geometry of 1d curves and 2d surfaces which is sometimes called classical differential geometry gauss figured out that the curvature at every point on a 2d surface could be summarized by a single number called the gaussian curvature at a given point if the nearby surface could be approximated by two smiles or two frowns then that point had a positive curvature if the nearby surface was made of a smile and a frown it had negative curvature and if the nearby surface had at least one straight line going through it then the curvature was zero meaning the surface could be unrolled into a flat sheet unfortunately this approach with gaussian curvature only works for two-dimensional surfaces to understand curvature in any dimension we need something called the riemann curvature tensor there are two ways to understand the riemann tensor the first is holonomy which is the twisting of a vector when it's parallel transported around a loop and the second approach is geodesic deviation which measures the spread of neighboring geodesics in the manifold in the last video we said that to parallel transport a vector on a curved surface we just march along a curve keeping the vector as straight as possible if we're at the north pole of a sphere and we parallel transport a vector forward sideways and backward up to the original point we notice that there's a change between the initial and final vectors this change in the vector after parallel transport around a loop is called holonomy and we can use holonomy to detect curvature in flat space like the surface of a flat table when we parallel transport a vector around a small loop the vector will be facing the same direction that it started in here there is no helonomy and therefore no curvature of the space but if we parallel transport a vector around a small loop and find that the resulting vector points in a different direction here we have holonomy and we conclude the space must be curved the riemann tensor can detect helonomy like this first we choose two vectors v and w and use them to make a parallelogram then we choose a third vector t to parallel transport around the parallelogram loop the difference between t at the start and the end of the journey is a vector called r of v and w acting on t here r is the riemann curvature tensor the riemann tensor is a function that takes three input vectors v w and t its output vector measures how much t has changed after it was parallel transported around the parallelogram formed by v and w the formula for this output vector is shown here and it's a bit complicated we have three terms involving covariant derivatives of t in the first two terms we have the covariant derivatives in the directions of w then v and then we subtract the covariant derivatives in the directions of v then w you can think of this as parallel transporting our t vector along v then w and then in the reverse directions of v then w to get back where we started but then what does this third term represent well sometimes with vector fields if we travel along v then w and then from the same starting point travel along w then v we end up at slightly different places the gap between the two destination points is given by the lee bracket of v and w also called the commutator of v and w this is given by v acting on w as a derivative operator and then subtracting w acting on v remember we're treating basis vectors as derivative operators so the vectors v and w can be thought of as linear combinations of partial derivative operators now i will admit that i've never seen a formal proof of this but based on intuition it seems like this third covariant derivative in the direction of the lee bracket provides an extra vector that closes this gap in the parallelogram if it exists one thing to note is that if the lee bracket vectors are given by basis vectors from a coordinate system then the lee bracket always goes to zero algebraically this is because the order of the partial derivatives doesn't matter and geometrically this is because the curves in a coordinate system always form nice closed grid boxes without any gaps at the corners since there's no gap this indicates the lee bracket is zero when the riemann tensor outputs the zero vector for every single combination of inputs this means that we never see helonomy so we never see vectors twisting when we parallel transport them around a loop so when a space is flat the riemann tensor will always output the zero vector if the riemann tensor can output non-zero vectors this means that the space is curved next i'll talk about the components of the riemann curvature tensor and its symmetries recall from relativity 106 a to get the components of a covector alpha we just get alpha to act on each of the basis vectors in our space so alpha acting on the basis vector e mu gives the component alpha mu also to get the components of the metric tensor g we just have g act on a pair of basis vectors so g acting on e mu and e new gives us the metric components g mu nu the riemann tensor components are the same way to get its components we just have the riemann tensor act on basis vectors e mu e new and e sigma and we get its components now remember the riemann tensor takes three vectors as input and outputs a fourth vector so notice that since the output is a vector we also have an extra upper index row that we use to sum with basis vectors and this gives the output vector result also you should notice that the riemann tensor component indices are written in a bit of a strange order the last two indices correspond to the two vectors we used to make the parallelogram and the first lower index corresponds to the vector being parallel transported around the parallelogram different textbooks might use different conventions for the order of these indices but this convention is the most common convention that i've seen now again recall that covector inputs are linear so we can either add input vectors or add the outputs and we'll get the same result this also applies for scaling we can scale the input vector or scale the output by the same amount and get the same result these two properties together mean we can always pull coefficients from vector summations outside the covector input this linearity property is true for all tensor inputs including the metric tensor inputs and the riemann tensor inputs this means that to get the result of the riemann tensor acting on any three vectors we can write each input vector as a linear combination of basis vectors and then bring all the scaling coefficients and summations outside and since this is the riemann tensor acting on basis vectors we can just rewrite it as the riemann tensor components now to get an actual formula for the riemann components we'd need to put basis vectors into this formula as i stated before the lee bracket goes to 0 for any basis vector inputs and the rest of the result becomes this big ugly formula the important thing to notice is that this formula only depends on the connection coefficients and nothing else so the curvature of a space is completely defined by the connection coefficients the full derivation for this formula is in tensor calculus video 23 which is linked in the description if all of the riemann tensor components are zero this means that the space is flat but if any of the components are non-zero this means the space is curved so the riemann tensor components have one upper index and three lower indices in four-dimensional space-time each of these four indices can have one of our four space-time variables this means that we have four times four times 4 times 4 equals 256 components in the riemann tensor which is a lot thankfully we don't need to actually calculate all 256 of them you already know that the space time metric is a four by four matrix with 16 elements however the matrix is symmetric and g mu nu equals g new mu so six of the entries are just repeats of the other entries this means there are only 10 independent components of the metric tensor matrix the riemann tensor components also have a number of symmetries between its four indices and it turns out in four dimensions out of the 256 components there are only 20 non-zero components that are independent the other components are either 0 or can be determined from the original 20. in two dimensions where the riemann tensor has 2 times 2 times 2 times 2 equals 16 components it turns out there's only one independent non-zero component the first of these symmetries says that when we swap the third and fourth indices of the riemann tensor we get the same component number but with a negative sign in front the reason this is true is because the third and fourth tensor indices correspond to the two vectors we use to make the parallelogram loop that we parallel transport around if we swap these two vectors this corresponds to going around the loop in the opposite direction which means that the parallel transported vector gets twisted in the exact opposite way so the output vector points in the opposite direction meaning it is the negative of the original output vector you should also notice that this index symmetry means that if the third and fourth indices are repeated the component is equal to the negative of itself which means the component is equal to zero so the symmetries of the riemann tensor components force some of the components to be zero automatically you can check the description for tensor calculus video 23 for full proofs of all of these symmetries you might notice that the riemann tensor is written with four lower indices here this is a shorthand notation for a summation of the riemann tensor with the metric tensor and is called lowering an index we can re-raise the index by doing a summation with the inverse metric tensor my tensors for beginners video 16 talks about raising and lowering tensor indices in more detail before moving on there's a second interpretation of the ribbond tensor called geodesic deviation where the riemann tensor measures how much a family of geodesics that start off close together spread out over space remember a geodesic is defined as the path we get when we parallel transport a vector v along itself or in other words saying the covariant derivative of v in the direction of v is zero so let's say this collection of curves are all geodesic curves so v is a vector field that's tangent to all these geodesic curves let's also say that this dashed line indicates the one second travel mark for all the geodesics and this is the two second mark and the three second mark the tangent vectors t on these dashed curves give an indication of how much these geodesics are separated from each other these geodesic curves and separation curves form a set of grid boxes kind of like a coordinate system so the lee bracket of v and t is zero now let's take our geodesic equation and take the covariance derivative of both sides in the direction of t the right hand side just stays zero then we'll add and subtract this term the first two terms are exactly equal to the riemann tensor of t and v acting on v the third term in the riemann tensor definition involving the lee bracket goes to zero since we said that the lee bracket of t and v goes to zero so this represents parallel transporting v around a parallelogram formed by t and v also in this term we can actually swap the order of v and t this is because of the zero lee bracket and also because of the torsionfree property of the connection i explain the complete reasons for why we can do this swap in my tensor calculus video number 21. so we end up with two covariant derivatives of the separation vector t is equal to the negative of this riemann tensor term since the vector t tells us about the separation between the geodesics this means that the riemann tensor can tell us how fast geodesics are spreading apart due to the curvature of the manifold as an example if we're looking at the surface of the moon if we started two geodesics pointing north on the moon's equator and then watched them travel over time they would get closer and closer together because of the curvature of the moon's surface so on curved manifolds geodesics can come together or spread apart simply because of the curvature of the manifold this is how gravity which is the curvature of space-time can cause objects to naturally come together without any forces geodesics and space-time can just naturally converge together due to the curvature of the space-time manifold another tensor describing the curvature of a manifold is the reachy curvature tensor the reachy tensor can be thought of as a kind of summary of the riemann tensor if you recall from linear algebra we get the trace of a matrix by adding up all its diagonal elements this means doing a summation over a matrix with itself where the two indices are the same the trace basically summarizes the matrix as a single number the reachy tensor is sort of like the trace of the riemann tensor we sum the riemann tensor with itself using the top index and middle lower index as the summation indices as a result we summarize the four by four by four by four elements of the riemann tensor as a four by four matrix called the richie tensor the richie tensor is symmetric so there are really only 10 independent elements you might wonder why we sum with the middle lower index and not the lower left or lower right indices it turns out that summing with the lower left index just gives zero and summing with the lower right index just gives the negative of summing with the middle index so doing those summations don't give us anything new and we just ignore them the physical interpretation of the reachy tensor is that it keeps track of how a volume changes along geodesics for example in 2d space we can make a square out of the vectors v and w and see how its area changes as the corners travel along geodesics or in 3d space we can see how a cube made out of vectors v w and t changes volume as its corners travel along geodesics the richie tensor is a function that takes two vectors and outputs a scalar if v is a unit vector when we put in the same vector v twice the resulting scalar is called the richie curvature the richie curvature is a bit like a constant of proportionality that helps relate a volume and its second derivative rate of change in the direction of v i'll explain how to visualize this let's say that we pick a direction v and we look at how geodesics change along this path if the geodesics converge together then this circle living in the plane of the basis vectors e1 and e2 will get smaller as it travels along the geodesics this means the space has positive reachy curvature along the direction v if the geodesics diverge apart then the circle will get bigger this means the space has negative richie curvature in the direction of v if the geodesics don't diverge or converge then the circle stays the same size and we have zero reached curvature in the direction of v now something to keep in mind we might run into a case where some geodesics converge but other geodesics diverge and the circle will get squashed smaller in one direction but stretched bigger in another direction but overall the area will stay the same in this case the reachy curvature in the direction of v is also zero because the area of the circle has not changed the reachy tensor can only detect changes in area or volume it cannot detect changes in shape here even though the shape of the circle has changed the overall area has not changed so the reachy curvature here would be zero so this is a very important point the richie tensor being zero does not mean our space is flat we can have a zero reachy tensor and still have a curved space a zero richie tensor simply means the curvature of space doesn't result in volume changes when we move along geodesics but the curvature of space can still cause changes in shape when we move along geodesics the last way of measuring curvature is the richie curvature scaler we get this by raising one index of the reachy tensor and then summing over the top and bottom indices to get a scalar in flat space a circle of radius r has a circumference of 2 pi r and an area of pi r squared but in curved space like the surface of this sphere a circle with the exact same circumference can actually have a larger interior area because the curved surface of the sphere causes the area to bulge out so in curved spaces a circle can have an area that's bigger or smaller than pi r squared due to the curvature of space a positive richie scalar means the circle in curved space has more area than a circle in flat space with the same circumference this also means a circle in curved space has less area than a circle in flat space with the same radius if we're measuring the radius as the walking distance from the middle to the edge of the circle a negative richie scalar means the opposite a circle in curved space has less area for a given circumference and a larger area for a given radius than we would expect in flat space and a zero richie scalar means the area of a circle is exactly what we would expect in flat space pi r squared so looking at the einstein field equations we see that the left-hand side contains the metric richie tensor and richie scalar the left-hand side of the einstein field equations is all about geometry and curvature in the next couple videos we'll talk about the hand side which is about mass energy and momentum the last thing we'll do in this video is proved that the rindler metric describes flat space time recall from relativity 105 part b the rindler coordinates c t tilde and x tilde are a space-time coordinate system for an accelerating observer with constant proper acceleration alpha this observer travels along a hyperbola that's a constant proper distance of capital d equals c squared over alpha from the origin if you recall when we looked at a collection of accelerating spaceships all separated by a constant proper distance of d from each other the clocks on each spaceship would tick at different rates spaceships farther from the origin would have clocks that ticked faster we were able to calculate the proper times of each ship using the rindler metric from relativity 105 d the rendler metric is just the dot products of the basis vectors and render coordinates and this helped us measure proper times along curves in the render coordinates we can determine the curvature of space time in the rindler coordinates using the following procedure we start with the metric for the coordinate system then we calculate the connection coefficients using the levicivita connection formula from the last video then we calculate the riemann curvature tensor and then use that to get the richie tensor and scalar so we start with our rindler metric which is a matrix of the space-time basis vector dot products i'm assuming there's no motion in the y and z directions so we're going to ignore ynz and just look at the 2x2 metric tensor matrix for time and x and recall g with upper indices is just the inverse metric matrix which sums with the ordinary metric to give the chronicler delta since the riddler metric is diagonal we can get its inverse matrix just by taking the reciprocal of the diagonal elements in the ordinary metric next we take the formula for the connection coefficients remember because the mu index appears up top and down low there's a summation over mu going on from zero to one we can also think of zero as being the space time index for time and one as being the space time index for x the connection coefficients have three indices if we're using t and x this means that there are two times two times two equals eight total coefficients it will turn out that a lot of these terms and coefficients go to zero so we're going to use some tricks to find these zero terms and get rid of them we're going to look at two separate cases for the coefficients in case one the alpha index will be t and in case 2 the alpha index will be x let's look at the alpha equals x case first the only way the inverse metric is non-zero is if mu equals x as well so we replace mu with x and ignore the t part of the summation you can check that the first two derivatives go to zero regardless of which values we use for nu and sigma and this last derivative is only non-zero if both nu and sigma are both t so we have a formula for the x t t christophel symbol the x x component of the inverse metric is negative one and g t t is x tilde over d all squared the derivative of x tilde squared is 2x tilde and canceling the two and the one-half and the minus signs we get a value of x-tilde over d-squared all the other christophel symbols with x up top go to zero now let's look at the alpha equals t case the only way the inverse metric is non-zero is if mu equals t as well so we replace mu with t and ignore the x part of the summation this third derivative with respect to time goes to zero right away since the metric does not depend on t tilde at all for the remaining two indices the choices that give us non-zero results are either nu equals t sigma equals x or nu equals x sigma equals t but these give the same connection coefficient result since swapping the lower indices doesn't change the value let's use nu equals t sigma equals x g inverse t t becomes d over x tilde all squared and g t t is x tilde over d all squared after taking the derivative we cancel the d squares cancel one half with two and cancel one factor of x tilde to get 1 over x tilde all the other connection coefficients with t as the upper index go to 0. so we find with riddler coordinates only three of the eight connection coefficients are non-zero these are the exact same results we got in relativity 105 part e except this time we got the results straight from the rindler metric and we didn't make use of any other coordinate systems now let's compute the riemann tensor components remember in 2d there's only one non-zero component that determines all the others so let's choose the t x t x component if we remember the connection coefficients we just calculated we can sub in gamma x t t and gamma t x t with the other two summations we need to find values of sigma that result in non-zero results the first sum goes to zero for both choices of sigma equals t and x the second sum is non-zero if we choose sigma equals t and we get one over x tilde times one over x tilde so the first derivative goes to zero since there's no time dependence the derivative of one over x tilde with respect to x tilde is negative one over x tilde squared and this cancels with the one over x tilde squared and the last term so we get zero so since the txtx component of the riemann tensor is zero using the symmetry rules we find that all components of the riemann tensor are zero this means that the rindler metric describes flat space time as expected this also means that the richie tensor components and richie scalar are also zero so to summarize this video we learned about three ways of measuring curvature the riemann tensor the richie tensor and the richie scalar we can interpret the riemann tensor as measuring holonomy which is the twisting of a vector when we parallel transport it around a loop or as a measure of the spread of nearby geodesics when space-time is flat this is the same thing as the riemann tensor being zero the richie tensor is like the trace of the riemann tensor and it keeps track of volume changes due to curvature as a volume travels along geodesics when the reachy tensor is zero it tells us that volumes don't change due to curvature but it's still possible for space to be curved even if the reachy tensor is zero and the richie scalar tells us if the area of a circle of a given circumference is more or less than we'd expect compared to a circle in flat space in the next video we're going to use the richie tensor to describe the curved space time of newtonian gravity
