in this video we're going to talk about the covariant derivative in flat space time i've already done five videos on the covariant derivative in my tensor calculus series which covers the covariant derivative in flat space curved space and abstract riemannian manifolds so you can check the description for links to those videos if you want in this video i'm only going to talk about the covariance derivative specifically for the case of flat space time covariant derivatives in curved space time will come in a later video in my relativity 104 f video i did a number of examples of taking derivatives of space time four vectors for example i took the derivative of four velocity u with respect to proper time tau to get the four acceleration a however when i took these derivatives i was working in an inertial reference frame where the basis vectors are constant everywhere in space time this made things simple because when i took the derivative of a term that was a vector component multiplied by a basis vector using product rule i could ignore the part of the result that had a derivative of the basis vector since basis vectors are constant everywhere in inertial frames the derivative went to zero and i didn't have to worry about it so inertial frames are nice because the basis vectors are constant and their derivatives always go to zero however in non-inertial frames of reference the basis vectors are changing everywhere in space-time in the past couple videos we've seen that in riddler coordinates basis vectors can change size and direction at different points in space-time this means that if we need to take the derivative of a vector in riddler coordinates or other non-inertial coordinate systems the derivatives of the basis vectors could be non-zero so we can't ignore basis vector derivatives to take the derivative of a four vector properly we need to use product rule to differentiate both the vector components and the basis vectors the basis vectors might change in non-inertial frames so we need to be sure to include their derivatives as i've said many times before basis vectors and vector components are like two sides of the same coin we can't talk about one without also talking about the other a derivative that makes physical sense needs to take the change of both vector components as well as basis vectors into account in order for it to make sense in flat space time the covariant derivative just means taking a derivative where we remember to take the derivatives of basis vectors into account it basically just means we take the derivative properly and don't ignore changing basis vectors the definition of covariant derivative gets a little more complicated in curved space time but for now when i say take the covariance derivative of a four vector we just mean that we differentiate both the vector components and the basis vectors we're going to do three examples of covariant derivatives in this video first in riddler coordinates we'll take the derivative of four position s with respect to proper time to get the four velocity u then again in render coordinates we'll take the derivative of four velocity u with respect to proper time to get the for acceleration a and finally we'll take the derivative of a generic four-vector v with respect to a generic path parameter lambda and will do it in a way that works in any coordinate system not just the render coordinates also in this video when i write variables or basis vectors without any markings on top they represent inertial coordinates which show how an inertial observer measures time and space variables and basis vectors with a tilde on top represent rindler coordinates which show how a non-inertial observer with constant proper acceleration measures time and space and variables and basis vectors with a smile on top represent a general coordinate system which can be any set of arbitrary curves that form a grid pattern on the space-time diagram before we do any covariant derivatives let's do a quick review of rindler coordinates first i'm going to remind you that in relativity 105b we learned the equations for converting between inertial coordinates and rindler coordinates which are the space-time coordinate system for an observer traveling with constant proper acceleration alpha then in relativity 105c we learned about the multivariable chain rule and also that basis vectors are actually tangent vectors along coordinate curves these two facts allowed us to find basis change equations from inertial coordinates to rindler coordinates summarized in this matrix equation with the jacobian matrix and we can rewrite all these equations with the standard basis vector notation instead of the tangent vector notation and we also learned how to do this in the reverse direction with the inverse jacobian matrix now in inertial coordinates the four position vector s equals c t e t plus x e x but using the change of basis equations i just talked about we find that in riddler coordinates s just equals x tilde e x tilde with zero time component this is because the four position vector s is always parallel to the e x tilde basis vector in riddler coordinates so we can build s completely out of e x tilde basis vectors and technically speaking a four vector should have four components in space time but i'm going to assume that the y and z components are zero in this video for simplicity and just use time and x with the review out of the way let's take the covariant derivative of the four position vector s with respect to proper time tau so basically we have an observer whose four position vector s is moving along a world line parameterized by the proper time tau and we want to find the four velocity vectors u for the observer on this world line the derivative of s in inertial coordinates is easy because we only need to take the derivatives of the vector components the basis vectors are constant everywhere in space time and we could ignore them when we take derivatives but in render coordinates the basis vectors can change from point to point so to take this derivative we use product rule to get one term with the derivative of the vector component and another term with the derivative of the basis vector e x tilde the derivative of the e x tilde basis vector is the hard part of this equation to make it a bit easier we can use multi-variable chain rule to break this derivative down into two parts our new job is to figure out the derivative of the e x tilde basis vector in the direction of the c t tilde coordinate and the direction of the x tilde coordinate remember using multi-variable chain rule we already found the equations of the rindler basis vectors in terms of the inertial basis vectors we can take the derivative of e x tilde in the x tilde direction by subbing in this formula for e x tilde it turns out that there's nothing in this formula that depends on x tilde c t tilde does not depend on x tilde by definition since it's an independent coordinate and e t and e x are inertial basis vectors that are constant everywhere in space time so they don't depend on e x tilde either so this derivative is just the zero vector meaning e x tilde does not change in the x tilde direction we can also calculate the derivative of e x tilde in the c t tilde direction once again e t and e x are constant so we just differentiate this formula with respect to ct tilde cinch becomes kosh and kosh becomes cinch and we multiply both of these terms by their inner constants because of chain rule now this big formula looks exactly like the formula for the e t tilde basis vector if we were to divide it by x tilde so this derivative is just equal to e t tilde divided by x tilde or in other words multiplied by 1 over x tilde so returning to the derivative of e x tilde with respect to tau expanded using chain rule we've found this derivative in the x tilde direction is zero and this derivative in the c t tilde direction is one over x tilde times e t tilde so when taking the covariant derivative and doing product rule we now know the value of this basis vector derivative and canceling these x tilde terms we get the final result for the covariant derivative of s with respect to tau in riddler coordinates and this result is not very surprising it's the exact same formula we would get if we were to expand ds by d tau using multivariable chain rule in riddler coordinates we just calculated this same result in a slightly different way so part of this result comes from the derivative of s's component and the other part of the result comes from the derivative of s's basis vector and we need both parts or else we get the wrong answer as a sanity check to make sure this formula makes sense we can test it out on our hyperbolic world line which is a world line with constant proper acceleration alpha for this world line c t tilde equals c tau and x tilde equals the constant value of c squared over alpha we get the expected result of an observer who has no x velocity so they believe they are stationary and the time component of their for velocity is c which is what stationary observers should have however this general formula for the four velocity will work for any world line that we can come up with that is parameterized in render coordinates not just this hyperbolic world line here for this second part of the video let's take the covariant derivative of the for velocity u to get the for acceleration a in riddler coordinates so just to be clear the components of u in any coordinate system are always equal to the derivatives of the coordinate variables with respect to tau we know this because u is equal to ds by d tau and expanding its components using multi-variable chain rule the components are just the derivatives of the coordinate variables with respect to tau now of course taking the derivative of u in an inertial frame is easy because we can ignore the derivatives of the constant basis vectors and we just take the derivatives of the components so we get the second derivatives of the coordinate variables with respect to proper time but in riddler coordinates this derivative is harder to take the derivative of both of these terms we need to use product rule twice to get one set of terms with the derivatives of the components and another set of terms to get the derivatives of the basis vectors fortunately for us we already calculated the derivative of e x tilde in the previous part of the video but now we need to calculate the derivative of e t tilde with respect to tau we can use the same strategy as before expanding the derivative using multivariable chain rule and computing the derivatives of the basis vector in the ct tilde and x-tilde directions so looking at the derivative of e t tilde in the x tilde direction we can treat c t tilde as constant since it is an independent variable and we can treat e t and e x as constant since they are inertial basis vectors this means that we just differentiate with respect to x tilde which means the x tildes in this formula go to one and the result we get is just the e t tilde basis vector divided by x tilde as for the derivative of e t tilde in the c t tilde direction we treat x tilde e t and e x as constant and differentiate with respect to c t tilde so kosh becomes cinch cinch becomes cosh and we multiply by the inner constant by chain rule and all of this is just the e x tilde basis vector but with all the terms multiplied by these repeated constants and x tilde so this derivative equals the square of alpha over c squared times x tilde times e x tilde if we use the definition of the rindler distance capital d we could also rewrite this as x tilde over d squared times e x tilde so given the chain rule expansion of d e t tilde by d tau if we sub in the basis vector derivatives that we calculated in the direction of the coordinate variables we get the full expression for this derivative here so going back to our original covariant derivative of u with respect to tau we already had the e x tilde derivative from before and just now we calculated the e t tilde derivative so we can sub these in also if we replace u t tilde with d c t tilde by d tau and replace u x tilde with d x tilde by d tau and distribute we get this so this is our final result for the covariant derivative of 4 velocity with respect to tau and rendler coordinates as you can see the formula is pretty complicated we get the ordinary second derivatives of the components that we expect but we also get extra terms because of the derivatives of the basis vectors again we can do a sanity check and test this formula on our standard hyperbolic world line where ct tilde equals c tau and x tilde equals the constant c squared over alpha we get the expected result of a constant proper acceleration alpha in the positive e x tilde direction but again this general formula for the for acceleration works for any world line that we can invent as long as it is parameterized in the render coordinates for the last part of this video let's take the covariant derivative of a general 4 vector v with respect to a generic path parameter lambda and we're going to figure out the formula in a general coordinate system that doesn't necessarily have to be riddler coordinates but before we do that i really want you to understand that the key for taking covariant derivatives is being able to figure out how the basis vectors of your coordinate system change from point to point in other words the key to computing covariant derivatives is figuring out the partial derivatives of the basis vectors with respect to the coordinate variables we spent the previous parts of this video doing exactly this for riddler coordinates we found that the derivative of e x tilde in the x tilde direction is zero which makes sense since if we look at the e x tilde basis vector in riddler coordinates and watch what happens if we move along a line of x tilde the vector stays the exact same so it does not change in the x tilde direction and if we watch what happens to the e x tilde basis vector when we move along a c t tilde coordinate curve we see that the vector begins to tilt in the e t tilde direction which is why the result of this derivative is a vector in the e t tilde direction also if we take the e t tilde basis vector and watch what happens when we move in the x tilde direction we find that the vector gets longer in the e t tilde direction which is why the derivative points in the e t tilde direction as well the percentage increase gets smaller and smaller as we move further from the origin though which is why the rate of increase is one over x tilde the rate of change decreases as x tilde goes up finally if we watch what happens to an e t tilde basis vector when we move along a c t tilde curve we find that it starts tilting in the direction of e x tilde which is why the results of this derivative points in the e x tilde direction and we get more and more tilting the further we are from the origin which is why x tilde is in this formula because the rate of change is greater farther from the origin also the fact that partial e t tilde by partial x tilde is the exact same as partial e x tilde by partial c t tilde is not a coincidence remember that basis vectors are really just tangent vectors along coordinate curves so both of these derivatives are equal to the second partial derivative of s with respect to c t tilde and x tilde and since the order of partial derivatives doesn't matter both of these terms are the exact same if we were to write each of these four basis vector derivative terms each in terms of the two basis vectors we find that the changes of the basis vectors can be described by a total of eight numbers in the case of rindler coordinates five of these numbers are zero and two of the remaining three numbers are identical because of the symmetry we talked about before these eight numbers that keep track of the changes of the basis vectors have a special name we call these terms the christophel symbols and they are denoted by the greek letter capital gamma with three indices upper index tells us which basis vector they are matched with so when we see t up top we know it's paired with the time basis vector and x on top means it is paired with the x basis vector the first lower index tells us which changing basis vector we are keeping track of and the second lower index tells us which coordinate variable we are moving along in the derivative each of these three indices has two possibilities either t or x so there are two times two times two equals eight different christopher symbols overall so when we're taking the derivative of a general four-vector v with respect to a general path parameter lambda in any coordinate system here are the steps that we follow we expand v into its components in this coordinate system's basis and apply the derivative to each term we then use product rule to take the derivative of these components and also the derivative of the basis vectors we expand the two basis vector derivatives with respect to lambda using multivariable chain rule so that we get four derivatives of the basis vectors with respect to the coordinate variables finally we expand each basis vector derivative result again into the basis using the christoffel symbols as the components this gives us eight total terms related to the derivatives of the basis vectors and two terms related to the derivatives of the original components of these 10 total terms 5 of them are written with the time basis vector and 5 of them are written with the x basis vector now remember the derivative of the time basis vector with respect to x is equal to the derivative of the x basis vector with respect to time because both of these are just equal to the second partial derivative of s with respect to the x and time variables we can expand each of these derivative vectors in a basis in terms of the christophel symbols denoted with capital gamma this means that the christopher symbols attached to the time basis vectors must be equal to each other so for the christophel symbols with the t index up top we can swap the lower t and x indices and get the same result and the christopher symbols attached to the x basis vectors must be equal to each other so for the christophel symbols with x up top we can also swap the lower t and x indices to get the same result so even though there are eight total christophel symbols two of them get repeated so there are really only six unique christophel symbols in inertial coordinate systems where the basis vectors do not change at all all the basis vector derivatives are zero meaning all the christophel symbols are also zero this makes the formula for the covariant derivative significantly simpler in inertial coordinate systems but in non-inertial coordinate systems we need to remember to keep track of the changing basis vectors and include the christophel symbols in our derivative formula so when we want to take the covariant derivative of a general 4 vector with respect to a general path parameter in any coordinate system that we want we use this big formula here where we need to compute the christopher symbols to keep track of the changing basis vectors so to summarize this video to calculate the covariant derivative of a four vector along a world line in space time we need to remember to use product rule to take the derivative of both the vector components and the basis vectors and the changing of the basis vectors can be broken up into small pieces where each piece is a derivative of the basis vector with respect to coordinate variables and each of these basis vector derivatives can be expanded out in a basis where the coefficients of these vectors are the christophel symbols denoted with a capital gamma in this video we solved for the christophel symbols in riddler coordinates by taking derivatives of the basis vectors written in the inertial basis and then changing back to the rindler basis using the change of basis equations in future videos i'll show a formula that will let us calculate the christophel symbols in any coordinate system using the metric tensor now a couple more points before i finish in this video we simplified four-dimensional space-time to only two dimensions time and x this meant that there were two times two times two equals eight total christopher symbols in the full four dimensional space time any of these three christopher symbol indices can be t x y or z so there are actually four times four times 4 equals 64 christopher symbols in total it becomes ridiculous to write them all out individually so in a later video i will show how to use summation notation to make these formulas more compact another question you might have is why is the covariant derivative called the covariant derivative well unfortunately the word covariant has two meanings in physics the first meaning is in the sense of the opposite behaviors of covariance and contravariance like when the basis vectors get smaller and the vector components get bigger the second meaning of covariant just means that something is the same in all coordinate systems or in other words something that is invariant the covariant derivative is about the second of these two meanings the covariant derivative of a four vector is the same in all coordinate systems even if different coordinate systems will disagree on its components in my opinion the name invariant derivative would have been better for this concept since the result is invariant and the same in all coordinate systems but covariant derivative is the name that history decided on so that's the name that we're going to use
