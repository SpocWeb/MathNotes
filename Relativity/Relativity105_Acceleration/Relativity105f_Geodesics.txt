in this video we're going to talk about geodesic curves which are the space-time curves that inertial frames and beams of light travel along in special relativity and general relativity as well remember an inertial frame of reference is a frame of reference that will always measure zero acceleration on an accelerometer that they are carrying with them the acceleration that an observer measures on their own accelerometer is called their proper acceleration and it is denoted by alpha as i explained in relativity 105 part a the proper acceleration is basically the length of an observer's for acceleration vector a which is the second derivative of their four position vector s with respect to proper time tau so we can define an inertial observer by saying their proper acceleration alpha is zero or by saying therefore acceleration vector a is the zero vector both of these definitions are equivalent we normally think of inertial observers as having straight world lines on a space-time diagram for example if einstein is an inertial observer and we take a look at a space-time diagram from his perspective then if physicist richard feynman is standing stationary with respect to einstein some distance away then feynman's world line will be a straight vertical world line next to einstein's we also normally think of beams of light as having straight world lines on a space-time diagram for example this beam of light moving left to right has a straight world line angled at 45 degrees you might be tempted to make the statement that inertial observers and beams of light will always travel in straight lines on a space-time diagram however this statement is not true in fact inertial observers and beams of light can have curved world lines in space-time diagrams to see how this is possible let's recall that an observer traveling with constant proper acceleration will travel in a hyperbolic curved world line in space time an observer with constant proper acceleration alpha measures time and space using the rindler coordinate system where curves of constant x are hyperbolas and curves of constant time are straight lines extending from the origin we also denote the distance c squared over alpha by the letter d for convenience so let's say that we have rindler traveling along this green hyperbolic world line which is a non-inertial world line and we also have feynman traveling along this blue straight vertical world line which is an inertial world line now let's take this space-time diagram and reshape it so that we view space-time from riddler's point of view so that the rindler coordinate lines form a square grid we can now see that from rindler's point of view his own green world line is now straight and vertical and he appears stationary in space meanwhile the blue inertial world line of feynman is no longer a straight line it is now curved in an inertial observer's coordinate system feynman's inertial world line is straight with a constant x value but according to rindler feynman's blue world line is now curved and makes the shape of a hyperbolic secant curve let's do the same thing for a beam of light which has a straight diagonal world line in an inertial frame from rindler's point of view this beam of light does not have a straight world line either an inertial observer sees a light beam as having a straight diagonal world line with a slope of one but rindler sees this beam of light as traveling along an exponential world line so really it is more correct to say that from the point of view of an inertial reference frame that measures zero on an accelerometer that they carry with them other inertial observers and beams of light will always have straight world lines but from the point of view of non-inertial reference frames inertial observers and beams of light can have curved world lines so we should stop thinking of inertial world lines as being straight world lines instead the correct definition of an inertial world line is a world line that has a zero for acceleration vector this definition of inertial world lines is correct for all coordinate systems whether the coordinate systems are inertial or non-inertial but what about the world lines of beams of light the proper time tau for light like world lines is always zero so light like world lines don't have a well-defined for acceleration vector because for acceleration involves derivatives with respect to proper time tau instead we can define light-like world lines using a slightly modified definition instead of saying the second derivative of four position with respect to tau is zero we'll say that the second derivative of four position with respect to a generic path parameter lambda is equal to zero the lambda parameter doesn't have to have any physical meaning it just needs to be able to indicate the path of a light beam in space time as its value increases it turns out that the second derivative of s with respect to lambda equaling zero describes not only light-like world lines but inertial world lines as well we can prove this using chain rule product rule and by remembering that the four velocity u is orthogonal to for acceleration a as we proved in relativity 105 part a you can pause the video if you want to study this proof also remember that for any massive observer therefore velocity u dotted with itself equals the speed of light squared we can use this fact to change the ending of this proof to prove that the proper time tau is a linear function of the path parameter lambda which is sometimes called the affine parameter so this equation where the second derivative of for position s with respect to a path parameter lambda equals the zero vector is called the geodesic equation the world lines that satisfy the geodesic equation are called geodesics these include inertial world lines that have zero proper acceleration and also the world lines of light world lines of light are called light-like geodesics or null geodesics because their slope is given by a vector that has zero minkowski length inertial world lines are sometimes called time-like geodesics because their slope is given by a time-like vector that has a positive minkowski length and is angled more vertically than a light-like vector there are also space like geodesics defined with a space-like vector but i won't be talking about those in this video it turns out that inertial observers will always see geodesics as being straight lines but non-inertial observers will see geodesics as being curved in this video we will show that in riddler coordinates inertial observers have a geodesic world line given by a hyperbolic secant next we will show that light beams in render coordinates have exponential world lines finally we will use the geodesic equation to solve for any geodesic curve and rendler coordinates i will also show how the geodesic equation relates to the christophel symbols we talked about in the last video let's start by looking at inertial world lines in an inertial coordinate system the geodesic equation tells us that the second derivative of s with respect to a path parameter lambda is zero in inertial coordinate systems we know that the four position s equals c t e t plus x e x if we ignore the y and z dimensions we also know that basis vectors are constant everywhere in inertial coordinate systems so the derivative of the basis vectors are always zero so to get the second derivative of s we just take the second derivative of its components ct and x because the derivatives of the basis vectors are zero and we can treat them as constant in this case the geodesic equation becomes two component equations the second derivative of ct equals zero and the second derivative of x equals zero the solutions to these differential equations are both linear equations in the lambda variable so a constant multiplied by lambda plus another constant the additive constants kt and kx represent the initial four position s of the geodesic curve when lambda equals zero and the constants that multiply lambda give the initial direction vector s by d lambda when lambda equals zero as our first example of a geodesic curve if we take these equations we can look at the geodesic we get when we set kt equals negative one kx equals two dt equals two and dx equals one our initial starting vector is negative one e t plus two e x seen here on the space time diagram and the initial direction vector is 2 e t plus 1 e x seen here by selecting various values of lambda we can travel up and down on this line this straight world line is a geodesic because its path in space time satisfies the geodesic equation in this case the world line represents someone traveling to the right at constant velocity another example is given by setting kt equals zero and kx equal to a constant x naught and dt equals one and dx equals zero the initial position vector is x naught e x and the initial direction is e t and choosing different values of lambda puts us anywhere on this line this geodesic world line represents the world line of an inertial observer that's stationary and not moving in space so we've confirmed that in inertial coordinate systems geodesic curves which give us inertial reference frames are straight lines now let's look at space time using the rindler coordinates x tilde and ct tilde the equations that change between inertial coordinates ct x and render coordinates c t tilde x tilde are here let's take a look at our stationary observer with a vertical world line with a constant x value of x naught the equations for this world line are ct equals the path parameter lambda and x equals the constant x-naught the inertial x-coordinate is equal to the rindler x-tilde coordinate times the hyperbolic cosine of ct tilde over d where d equals c squared over the constant proper acceleration of the rendler observer we can set this equal to the constant x naught for our vertical world line dividing both sides by the cosh term we get that x tilde equals the constant x naught times one over cosh and one over cosh is the definition of the reciprocal trig function hyperbolic secant or sec h also if we take the formula for ct and plug in our new formula for x tilde we get cinch over cosh which is the definition of hyperbolic tangent now it's important to notice that the output of the tang function is always between negative one and positive one and so the output of x naught times tange is always between negative x naught and positive x naught this means that for rindler coordinates this vertical world line is only defined between ct equals negative x naught and ct equals positive x naught this makes sense because the rindler observer does not have access to any space-time events beyond these two world lines which are sort of like horizons so this world line that appears vertical in inertial coordinates actually looks like a hyperbolic secant when viewed from the perspective of rendler coordinates in inertial coordinates this inertial world line is given by x equals a constant x naught but in riddler coordinates this inertial world line is given by x tilde equals x naught times hyperbolic secant of c t tilde over d so this shows that inertial world lines do not always look like straight lines in all coordinate systems in non-inertial coordinate systems inertial world lines can look like curves also in inertial coordinates if an inertial world line is not completely vertical and has a slope given by beta its equation in riddler coordinates is still given by a hyperbolic secant curve but it is rescaled and shifted depending on the slope beta if we define beta as being the hyperbolic tangent of a hyperbolic angle phi and knowing this hyperbolic trig identity it's possible to prove this again you can pause the video if you want to study this proof next let's show that in riddler coordinates light beams have exponential world lines let's start again with our geodesic equation for inertial coordinates and this time we'll take kt equals 0 kx equals the constant x naught and we'll take dt and dx to both be 1. in this case the initial position vector is x naught e x so it points completely in the direction of the x-axis also the initial direction vector is e t plus e x so it points diagonally to the upper right at an angle of 45 degrees the lambda parameter will let us move anywhere on this resulting world line as you can probably see this geodesic is the familiar world line of a beam of light that's traveling to the right so previously we saw that some solutions to the geodesic equations gave us inertial world lines which are straight lines and inertial coordinates but other solutions to the geodesic equations can also give us the world lines of light beams which are also straight lines in inertial coordinates now let's look at what a light beam looks like in the rindler coordinate system in inertial coordinates a diagonal 45 degree light beam traveling to the right has the equation x equals ct plus a constant x naught where x naught tells us where the light beam intersects the x axis let's sub in this rindler expression with cosh for x and sub in this rindler expression with cinch for time ct now let's rewrite cosh and cinch using their exponential representations remember cosh equals one-half of a positive exponential plus a negative exponential and cinch equals one-half of a positive exponential minus a negative exponential the positive exponentials on both sides cancel out and if we move one half of minus this negative exponential to the other side one half and one half together give us one so the left hand side now is x tilde times e to the minus c t tilde over d we can move this negative exponential to the other side of the equation just through division which changes it to a positive exponential so now we have the equation of the beam of light in render coordinates x tilde equals the constant x naught times e to the c t tilde over d so we can see that in inertial coordinates a beam of light has the equation of a diagonal line but when we change to rindler coordinates a beam of light looks like an exponential curve if we wanted to look at beams of light traveling left instead we would just add a minus sign to the ct and the inertial coordinate equation or a negative sign to the ct tilde in the render coordinate equation we can see that these also result in exponential curves so in inertial coordinates the geodesics of beams of light have diagonal world lines at 45 degrees but in riddler coordinates the geodesics of beams of light have exponential world lines so we've seen how geodesics for inertial observers give us straight lines and for rendler observers give us hyperbolic secant curves we've also seen how geodesics for light beams give us diagonal lines in inertial coordinates and exponential curves in rindler coordinates finally let's use the geodesic equation to solve for any geodesic curve in riddler coordinates and to do this we will use the christophel symbols in riddler coordinates so far in this video our technique for finding geodesics in riddler coordinates has been to start with a straight line in inertial coordinates and then change coordinates to the render variables so that we can get the geodesic world lines expressed in rendler coordinates but it's actually possible to figure out what the geodesics look like in riddler coordinates without referencing inertial coordinates at all we do this by solving the geodesic equation in render coordinates where the four position vector s is equal to x tilde e x tilde i already showed how to take the covariant derivative in riddler coordinates in relativity 105 part e so we already know that the second derivative of s in riddler coordinates looks like this and the zero vector expressed in riddler coordinates is just zero e t tilde plus zero e x tilde by setting the time components equal to each other and the x components equal to each other we get two equations these are the geodesic equations in component form for rindler coordinates now i'm just going to warn you that the solutions to these differential equations are definitely not obvious we have a product of the ct and x derivatives so these equations are non-linear and also the ct and x variables are mixed together in both equations meaning these differential equations are coupled both of these facts make it very frustrating to solve for ct and x the solution i'm going to show you involves a lot of clever tricks that i got from reading course notes and online articles and i never would have been able to come up with it on my own so i'm just warning you that the steps for solving these equations will seem a bit strange but for the purposes of this video the final result we get is the important part don't worry about the steps too much at this stage first off out of nowhere let's look at the expression k equals x tilde squared times the derivative of ct tilde with respect to lambda where k is a constant let's differentiate both sides with respect to lambda k is a constant so its derivative is zero for the derivative of the right hand side we use product rule to get a sum of terms one with the derivative of x tilde squared and one with the derivative of c t tilde's derivative to do the derivative of x tilde squared we use chain rule to get the derivative of the outside function to x tilde and the derivative of the inside function d x tilde by d lambda and this is just the second derivative of c t tilde if we divide both sides by x tilde squared we get exactly the first of our geodesic equations so the simple equation k equals x tilde squared times dct by d lambda is a bit like the antiderivative of the first of our geodesic equations k is called a constant of motion for the coordinate system because it is always constant for any geodesic world line we can also write this as k times 1 over x tilde squared equals the derivative of ct tilde our next trick will be to introduce a new variable we'll define 1 over w tilde to be equal to x tilde using power rule we get that dx tilde by dw tilde is minus 1 over w tilde squared if we take dx tilde by d lambda and use chain rule we get dx tilde over dct tilde times dct tilde over d lambda note that i'm using single variable chain rule here and these are not partial derivatives the partial derivative of x tilde with respect to c t tilde would be zero because they are independent variables but here we're considering x tilde and ct tilde describing a single curve so they are not independent of each other in this derivative we can use single variable chain rule again on this derivative to expand it in terms of w tilde now we know from our constant of motion that d c t tilde over d lambda is just k times one over x tilde squared and we know this derivative dx tilde by dw tilde is just negative 1 over w tilde squared after canceling we get this to be negative dw tilde by t tilde times k now let's calculate the second derivative of x tilde which is just the derivative of the first derivative that we calculated already we can expand d by d lambda using single variable chain rule in terms of c t tilde we can replace the derivative of c t tilde with our constant of motion expression and replace the first derivative of x tilde with the expression we got on the last slide so this just becomes the second derivative of w tilde with respect to c t tilde and we can replace one over x tilde squared with w tilde squared so we have our constant of motion and now the second derivative of x tilde we can take our second geodesic equation and move the second derivative of x tilde to the left side and pick up a minus sign now we can sub in our formula for the second derivative of x tilde and the first derivative of c t tilde here the x tilde on top times the square of 1 over x tilde squared gives us 1 over x tilde cubed which is just w tilde cubed we can cancel k squared on both sides and divide by w tilde squared on both sides to just end up with w tilde on the right hand side now finally we have a differential equation that says the second derivative of w tilde with respect to c t tilde is one over d squared times w tilde basically this means that the second derivative of w tilde is proportional to itself there are exactly two functions that have this property which are cosh and cinch so w tilde equals any combination of kosh and cinch of ct tilde over d with arbitrary constants c1 and c2 in front and remember w tilde is just 1 over x tilde taking the reciprocal of both sides we get a final expression for geodesics and render coordinates x tilde equals 1 over c1 times cosh plus c2 times cinch by making different choices for the constants c1 and c2 we can get every possible geodesic in the rindler coordinate system for example if we set c one equals one over x naught and c two equals zero we get that x tilde equals x naught times the hyperbolic secant of c t tilde over d this is exactly what we got for our example of a time-like geodesic which is an inertial frame in the first part of this video or if we set c1 to 1 over x naught and c2 to plus or minus 1 over x naught if we rewrite cosh and cinch in exponential form and do some cancelling we get that x tilde equals x naught times the exponential of plus or minus c t tilde over d this is exactly what we got for our examples of light like geodesics traveling either to the left or to the right in the second part of this video so basically no matter which reference frame we're in whether it is inertial or non-inertial we can get the equations of geodesics using the geodesic equation this equation will always give us the equations of motion for geodesics in any coordinate system to summarize this video we learned that a geodesic is a world line in space time that is straight in an inertial coordinate system and a geodesic always obeys the geodesic equation which says that the second derivative of the four position vector s with respect to a path parameter lambda is the zero vector for world lines that are time like this gives us the world lines of inertial frames and it is the equivalent of saying that a world line has zero for acceleration which is the second derivative of s with respect to proper time tau however if we use a general path parameter lambda instead of the proper time then the geodesic equation also applies for light-like world lines even though the proper time tau on a light-like world line is always zero we found that in inertial frames geodesics appear as straight lines for example a stationary observer having a constant x value or a beam of light traveling diagonally to the right with a slope of 1 at 45 degrees but we also found in rindler coordinates these same geodesics take the form of a hyperbolic secant for inertial frames and an exponential for light-like paths in inertial coordinates the geodesic equation is simple and the solutions are easy to get they're just the equations of straight lines but in render coordinates the geodesic equation is more complicated because the non-zero christopher symbols appear when we take the second derivative of the four position vector s when written in terms of the coordinate variables the expression in the geodesic equations always take the form of a second derivative of a coordinate plus some additional products of first derivatives multiplied by christophel symbols in future videos we'll see that the general geodesic equation for a general coordinate system looks like this so this video is the last video i have planned for talking about special relativity next we're going to talk about general relativity in general relativity since space-time is curved there is no such thing as a straight world line we're going to find that even though space-time is curved and there is no such thing as a straight world line the geodesic equation can still give us the world lines of freely falling observers in a gravitational field and also beams of light that take curved paths in curved space time
