in this video we're going to talk about basis vectors and the jacobian for curvilinear coordinates these tools will help us deal with the mathematics of non-inertial frames in special relativity and also eventually the curved space time of general relativity throughout this video series i've been trying to emphasize that we should think of vectors as being made of both basis vectors and vector components also when basis vectors change in one way a vector's components will change in the opposite way we saw this first in 2d space where making the basis vectors twice as big with a matrix of twos results in a vector's components becoming twice as small with a matrix of one-halfs then in galilean relativity we saw that when the space-time basis is transformed with a galilean matrix a vector's components are transformed with an inverse galilean matrix then in special relativity when the space-time basis is transformed using a lorentz matrix a vector's components are transformed using an inverse lorentz matrix in the last couple videos we've learned that an accelerating object has a different space-time basis at every point along its curved world line in order to change basis between an inertial frame and a non-inertial frame we need a transformation that knows how to change basis at every point along the accelerating object's world line the matrix that helps us do this is called the jacobian matrix when basis vectors transform with a jacobian matrix a vector's components will transform using the inverse jacobian matrix to understand the jacobian matrix we need to understand two ideas number one we need the multivariable chain rule and number 2 we need to think of basis vectors as tangent vectors along coordinate curves if you understand these two ideas you already know everything you need to know about the jacobian matrix everything afterward is just filling in the details and giving examples i've covered basis vectors and the jacobian before in videos 2 3 4 and 5 of my tensor calculus series the links to those videos are in the description the main difference is that the tensor calculus videos cover polar coordinates whereas this video will cover riddler coordinates the tensor calculus videos are more slow paced than this video so if you find this video confusing the tensor calculus videos might help make things clearer the first step to understanding the math of curvilinear coordinate systems is to review the multivariable chain rule i'm only going to give some quick intuition for why this rule is true if you want to formal proof you'll have to search it elsewhere online let's start with the single variable chain rule which tells us how to take the derivative of a nested function f of x of lambda if we have a single variable function f of x and we zoom in on a small region then the function looks like a straight line the height of this function is df and it's equal to a small step in the x direction dx times the line's slope which is the derivative df by dx so we have the relationship df equals df by dx times dx similarly if we have a function x of lambda when we zoom in the function looks like a straight line with a width of d lambda and a height of dx and a slope of dx by d lambda we get the relationship that height dx equals dx by d lambda times d lambda if we sub this formula in for dx in the first equation we get that df equals df by dx times dx by d lambda times d lambda and if we divide both sides by d lambda we get a formula to compute df by d lambda using the product of these two derivatives this formula is what lets us take the derivative of nested single variable functions and is called the single variable chain rule in the example of taking the derivative of f of lambda equals sine of lambda squared we can set x equals lambda squared then dx by d lambda is just two times lambda and df by dx is just cosine of x multiplying them and writing in terms of lambda we get cosine of lambda squared times 2 lambda the multivariable chain rule is similar if we have a function of two variables f of x and y and we zoom in on a small region of the function then the function looks like a flat plane the height of this small region is again df and it is equal to the sum of two changes first a small step in the x direction dx times the slope in the x direction partial f by partial x then we add to that a small step in the y direction d y times the slope in the y direction partial f by partial y so we have df equals partial f by partial x times dx plus partial f by partial y times d y if we sub in single variable chain rules that relate dx and d lambda and also d y and d lambda and divide all terms by d lambda we get the multivariable chain rule which lets us take the derivative of a nested multivariable function let's do an example f of lambda equals sine of lambda squared times sine of 5 lambda we can set lambda squared equals x and 5 lambda equals y dx by d lambda is just 2 lambda and d y by d lambda is just 5. now with partial derivatives with respect to x we treat all other variables in the formulas as if they are constants so we treat y as if it's a constant so the partial derivative of sine x sine y with respect to x is cosine x sine y and partial f by partial y is sine x cos y since we treat x as a constant subbing in x and y we get df by d lambda equals cosine of lambda squared times sine of 5 lambda times two lambda plus sine of lambda squared times cosine of five lambda times five again these are not proper proofs i'm mostly making an appeal to intuition for why the multivariable chain rule results in a sum of terms for each variable the idea of dividing by d lambda isn't a very mathematically rigorous or correct thing to do if you want a proper proof of these rules you can look them up online so that's multi-variable chain rule now let's look at interpreting basis vectors as tangent derivative vectors along a coordinate curve again i'm going to primarily focus on intuition here instead of being formally correct here are some examples of curves that each have a direction associated with them a tangent vector along a curve is basically a vector that just barely touches the curve at one point at the base of the vector it's basically like an instantaneous velocity vector for a particle traveling along the curve we can think of a curve as a position vector s whose tip is changing location as time goes on we can use the path parameter lambda to indicate the vector's position at a specific point as lambda increases the tip of the position vector s will change location sweeping out the shape of the path in space so a curve is really like a vector-valued function that takes a real number lambda as input and outputs a position vector s to get a tangent vector along this curve we start with a position vector s of lambda and then pick another position vector s of lambda plus h which is a small step h ahead of the first vector the difference of these two vectors looks like this if we divide this difference vector by h and then take the limit as h approaches zero we get the derivative of s with respect to lambda d s by d lambda as we make h smaller and smaller this vector becomes a vector that's tangent to the curve so this derivative d s by d lambda is a tangent vector along the curve s of lambda and actually d s by d lambda is a whole series of tangent vectors one tangent vector for each value of lambda along the curve these are basically like velocity vectors along the curve although the path parameter lambda does not necessarily have to be related to time it can be any abstract variable without physical significance let's take a look at tangent vectors along a curve where the curves are the coordinate curves in a coordinate system for example the curves of x and c t in standard inertial coordinates for space-time and the curves of c t tilde and x tilde in the rindler coordinates we're going to find that tangent vectors along these curves actually give us the basis vectors for these coordinate systems let's take a look at a curve where the path parameter variable is just x the curve is just a straight line that moves in the positive x direction let's say that we have a position vector s of x whose tip moves along a horizontal line according to the x variable we also have another position vector s of x plus h which is a small step h in front of it to get the tangent vector along this line let's look at the difference vector s of x plus h minus s of x divided by h for different values of h if we set h equals 2 then the difference vector s of x plus two minus s of x is two units long and dividing by h equals two this vector becomes one unit long if we set h equals one the difference vector is one unit long and dividing by h equals one it stays one unit long if h equals one-half the vector is one-half units long but dividing by h equals one-half it becomes one unit long again if we take the limit as h approaches zero then the resulting difference vector is always a horizontal vector that's one unit long that points in the positive x direction this limit can be thought of as a partial derivative of the vector s with respect to the x coordinate variable and the result is a horizontal vector one unit long which is exactly what the e x basis vector is we can repeat this process for any point in space time and get the same e x vector that's one unit long and pointing in the positive x direction repeating this approach for the direction of the ct variable we get a vertical basis vector one unit long so we can think of partial s by partial c t as the e t basis vector again the e t basis vector is the same for any point in space time and it's one unit long pointing in the positive c t direction we can also use this approach for the rindler coordinates the curves that measure x tilde are straight lines that radiate from the origin if we apply our normal limiting approach to calculate the tangent vector partial s by partial x tilde the tangent vectors point outward along the x tilde lines repeating everywhere in space-time we get the x-tilde basis vectors which point along the lines of constant time for accelerating observers traveling along the hyperbolas in space time unlike the e x and e t basis vectors the e x tilde basis vectors are not constant everywhere in space time they change direction depending on where the base of the arrow is located and doing the same thing for the c t tilde coordinate curves which are the hyperbolas the partial s by partial c t tilde vectors end up being tangent vectors to these hyperbolas these are the e t tilde basis vectors that point in the direction of constant position for accelerating observers note that these e t tilde basis vectors not only change direction at various locations they also change size they get longer as we move farther from the origin the reason for this is that a constant hyperbolic angle results in longer hyperbolic curves farther from the origin if we travel a longer curve for the same change in the ct variable then the tangent vector must be longer because we are covering more distance with the same change of the variable since we now understand multi-variable chain rule and also that basis vectors are tangent vectors along coordinate curves let's return to the problem of changing basis in curvilinear coordinate systems we need to figure out how to write the basis vectors e t tilde and e x tilde in terms of the basis e t and e x we do this by figuring out what the coefficients in front of the basis vectors should be in these formulas but remember basis vectors are really just partial derivatives of the space-time position vector s with respect to the coordinate variables and now filling in these coefficients is easy we just get them from the multi-variable chain rule these first two coefficients are partial ct by partial ct tilde and partial x by partial c d tilde and these next two coefficients are partial ct by partial x tilde and partial x by partial x tilde so we've seen that we can write a galilean transform of space-time basis vectors in array notation like this with the basis vectors written in a row and the coefficients written in a galilean matrix we also saw that we can write a lorentz transformation of basis vectors in array notation using a lorentz matrix and now we can write the multivariable chain rule method of changing basis vectors in array notation like this where this matrix of partial derivative coefficients is called the jacobian matrix we can also rewrite the basis vectors in the standard notation if we want let's calculate the coefficients needed to change bases between the standard space-time coordinates ct and x and the rindler coordinates ct tilde and x tilde we already know the equations for ct and x from the previous videos if we expand the time basis vector and rindler coordinates we see that we need to calculate these two partial derivatives with respect to ct tilde now before we start taking derivatives you might be confused about taking the derivative with respect to ct tilde to do this you just need to treat ct tilde as if it's a single variable alternatively since c is a constant you can also pull it out in front of the derivative as one over c and just take the derivative with respect to t tilde both of these approaches work just fine also as a reminder the derivative of cinch is cosh and the derivative of cosh is cinch you can easily prove this using their exponential representations so to get partial ct by partial ct tilde we just take the cinch and the formula and turn it into a cosh and then multiply the outside by the inner coefficient alpha over c squared we can do the same thing for partial x by partial ct tilde except we turn cosh into cinch we can simplify these formulas further by noticing that x tilde times cosh is just the formula for x and x tilde times cinch is just the formula for ct so the final coefficients to change bases are alpha over c squared x and alpha over c squared c t we can also expand the rindler e x tilde basis vector using the multivariable chain rule these derivatives with respect to x tilde are just the original formulas with the x tilde variable removed and we can also write these coefficients as c t over x tilde and x over x tilde so we found all the coefficients in these multi-variable chain rule formulas for converting between the standard space-time basis and the rindler space-time basis writing these formulas in array notation this also means we've found the coefficients of the jacobian matrix we can also rewrite all these formulas using the standard basis vector notation instead of the partial derivative notation for basis vectors we can also use this other pair of formulas derived in the last video where ct tilde equals arctange and x tilde equals the square root to do the transformation of the basis vectors in the opposite direction as a reminder we can take the derivative of the square root of a variable q with respect to q by treating the square root as an exponent operation with a power of one-half we can then use power rule to bring the one-half in front and decrease the exponent by one to get negative one-half which gives us a half times one over the square root of q and the derivative of arc tangent of q is 1 divided by 1 minus q squared because the internet told me so we can expand the standard coordinate time basis vector using chain rule this derivative with respect to ct involves a derivative of arctange which gives us 1 divided by 1 minus the square of the input we also need to use chain rule to take the derivative of the input with respect to ct which just gives us one over x if we change this one over x to x over x squared and multiply through then this becomes x over x squared minus c t squared and for the derivative of x tilde with respect to c t we get one half in front and then put the square root in the denominator again we need to use chain rule to take the derivatives of the term under the square root by c t and this just gives us negative two c t and here the one half and the two cancel and remember the square root of x squared minus c t squared is just x tilde by definition so this becomes x tilde squared and this becomes x tilde so our coefficients are c squared over alpha x over x tilde squared and negative ct over x tilde we can follow a similar procedure to expand the standard x basis vector using multivariable chain rule and we get the coefficients negative c squared over alpha c t over x tilde squared and x over x tilde using these coefficients we can get the inverse jacobian matrix once again we can also rewrite these formulas using the standard basis vector notation instead of the partial derivative notation we can try multiplying the jacobian matrix and the inverse jacobian matrix this row multiplied by this column gives us first entry times first entry plus second entry times second entry we can then fill in all the entries using this method if we add and multiply things out and remember that x tilde is the square root of x squared minus ct squared we find that the result is the identity matrix so the jacobian and the inverse jacobian matrices are indeed inverses if you want you can try and prove that the jacobian and the inverse jacobian always multiply to give the identity matrix in all cases not just in the case of rendler coordinates the proof involves using multi-variable chain rule backwards to collapse the sum of terms together i'll leave a link to the proof of this fact in the description it's worth noting that all the transformation matrices we've seen so far in this series including scaling matrices galilean matrices and lorentz matrices are all examples of jacobian and inverse jacobian matrices if we look at the scaling example and rescale the coordinates x y to be half as big to get x tilde and y tilde then the partial derivatives end up being one-half zero zero and one-half these form the entries of the inverse jacobian matrix which is just the matrix used to transform the vector components the jacobian matrix is the inverse of this a matrix of twos along the main diagonal and is used to transform the basis vectors to be twice as big if we take the galilean transform between coordinates t x and t tilde x tilde we get 1 0 negative v and 1. these are the entries of the inverse jacobian matrix which is just the inverse galilean matrix with the jacobian matrix giving the normal galilean matrix that transforms the basis vectors and if we take the lorentz transformation between coordinates ctx and ct tilde x tilde the partial derivatives are gamma negative beta times gamma negative beta times gamma and gamma these are the entries of the inverse jacobian matrix which is just the inverse lorentz matrix with the jacobian matrix just giving us the lorentz matrix that transforms the basis vectors so any coordinate transformation whether curvilinear or straight line has its own jacobian and inverse jacobian matrices that can be used to transform the basis vectors and vector components now the galilean and lorentz matrices have entries that are constant numbers and don't depend on the coordinates but the jacobian matrix between the standard inertial coordinates and the rindler coordinates does depend on the space-time coordinates so we get a different transformation for every point in space-time this is exactly what we need to change to the riddler basis since e t tilde and ex tilde basis vectors can change direction and length everywhere in space time if we choose this specific point in space time you can see that when we plug in x c t and x tilde we get the correct basis transformation equations now that we have the jacobian and the jacobian inverse matrices let's use them to change basis for some four vectors in space time so recall that the four velocity u equals the derivative of the four position s with respect to proper time tau using multi-variable chain rule we can expand this vector in any basis that we like where the components of the vector are the derivatives of the space-time coordinates with respect to proper time tau this is just like expanding a vector into its components as we've done many times before except this time the components come from the multi-variable chain rule we've already seen that we can use multi-variable chain rule to change between the standard space-time basis and the rindler space-time basis which results in a matrix formula using the jacobian matrix it turns out that we can also convert between these vector components using multi-variable chain rule which results in a matrix formula using the inverse jacobian this makes sense since the basis vectors are covariant and transform with the jacobian matrix vector components are contravariant and transform in the opposite way with the inverse jacobian matrix the opposite changes cancel out and we can write the same invariant vector using a different basis with different components now that we understand how the jacobian and inverse jacobian can help us change basis and change the components of a four-velocity vector let's look at an example let's say that einstein is standing still in our space-time diagram with a vertical world line and rindler is accelerating to the right with constant proper acceleration alpha along a hyperbolic world line you should know by now that einstein will have a four velocity vector u at every point along his world line the four velocity vectors are invariant and are agreed upon by all observers but the vector components that einstein measures in the basis e t e x will be different than the components rindler measures in the basis e t tilde e x tilde given what we've learned in this video let's get the components of these four velocity vectors using multi-variable chain rule and then use our knowledge of the jacobian and inverse jacobian matrices to change from einstein's components to rindler's components for these four velocity vectors doing this in einstein's frame will involve calculating the derivatives d c t by d tau and dx by d tau this means that we need equations for einstein's world line using einstein's proper time tau as the path parameter let's say that einstein is stationary with a constant position of c squared over alpha where c squared over alpha is also referred to as the rindler distance denoted with a capital d the ct coordinate in this case is simply the proper time according to einstein c times tau obviously the x coordinate is constant so dx by d tau is zero and dct by d tau is c when we expand the four velocity ds by d tau using multi-variable chain rule in einstein's basis we can plug in the components dct by d tau and dx by d tau and we see that the four velocity is just c times the time basis vector with zero space components this is the expected result for a stationary observer that has zero velocity in space but now we want to get einstein's four velocity vector components according to rindler using the e t tilde and ex tilde basis vectors in his coordinate system or equivalently the tangent vectors partial s by partial c t tilde and partial s by partial x tilde we know that we can convert between einstein's components and rindler's components using multivariable chain rule whose equations are summarized by this matrix multiplication with the inverse jacobian matrix we can then use the inverse jacobian that we calculated earlier and plug in einstein's four velocity components of c and zero after doing the matrix multiplication these terms go to zero so we already know the components of u in einstein's frame but if we sub these in we get the components of u in rindler's frame we get c times c squared over alpha times x over x tilde squared for rindler's time component and negative c times c t over x tilde for rindler's x component if we recall that the x coordinate for einstein's path is a constant value of x equals c squared over alpha we can sub this in for x and since c squared over alpha is just the riddler distance d we can replace this pair of c squared over alpha terms with d squared so we have einstein's four velocity vector components written in rindler's basis and we can confirm that they make sense based on our space-time diagram drawing when ct equals 0 einstein is on the x-tilde axis at a position of x tilde equals d this means that at c t equals zero einstein's four velocity vector points completely along the e t tilde direction which is completely vertical and matches our space-time diagram for ct greater than 0 the time component is positive and the x component is negative which matches our picture and for ct less than 0 both the time and the x components are positive which also matches our picture we can also look at the example of renders for velocity vectors and try to get the components in einstein's basis we'll say that rindler maintains a constant proper distance x tilde equals c squared over alpha from the origin which is his rendler horizon and that his time coordinate ct tilde is just c times the proper time in his own frame the derivatives with respect to tau are just c and 0 so his 4 velocity vector has components c and 0 in his own frame if we want the components of rindler's four velocity vector according to einstein's frame we can convert between the components using multivariable chain rule which results in a matrix formula that uses the jacobian matrix if we get the jacobian matrix we calculated before and multiply by rindler's four velocity components in his own frame then these terms go to zero and rindler's four velocity components in einstein's frame are just c times alpha over c squared times x for the time component and c times alpha over c squared times c t for the x component and again if we recall that c squared over alpha is the riddler distance we can replace alpha over c squared with one over d we now have rindler's four velocity vector components written in einstein's basis and we can again confirm that they match our diagram on the x-axis where ct equals 0 and x equals d rindler's 4-velocity is completely vertical as expected and for ct greater than 0 its time and x-components are both positive so it points toward the upper right and for ct less than zero the time component is positive but the x component is negative so it points to the upper left also as expected so to summarize this video we learned the multivariable chain rule and we learned that basis vectors can be thought of as tangent vectors along coordinate curves which is the derivative of a position vector with respect to a coordinate variable using the multivariable chain rule we can expand the four velocity vector into any basis that we like where the four vector components are the derivatives of coordinates with respect to tau we can also use the multivariable chain rule to convert between basis vectors written in matrix form using the jacobian matrix and convert between the vector components written in matrix form using the inverse jacobian matrix one very last thing i'll point out is that the four position vector s is normally written c t e t plus x e x in einstein's frame but in rindler's frame s is written as just x tilde times e x tilde with no time component at all this is because the e x tilde basis vector always points in a direction parallel to s so s's time component is always zero in rindler's basis we'll talk about this more in the next couple videos
