in this video we're going to continue talking about acceleration and special relativity by talking about bell's spaceship paradox bell's spaceship paradox will lead us to inventing riddler coordinates our first set of curvilinear coordinates in this relativity series bell's spaceship paradox is one of many so-called paradoxes in special relativity like the twin paradox and the latter paradox at first these paradoxes seem like contradictions that indicate flaws in special relativity but more careful thinking reveals that there is no paradox at all and special relativity works just fine bell's spaceship paradox works like this let's say that there are two spaceships some distance d apart there is a string that ties the two spaceships together the string is exactly long enough to cover the distance between the spaceships if the spaceships move even slightly further apart the string will break einstein is standing stationary halfway between the two spaceships and sends a light signal to each one which tells each ship to begin accelerating to the right the spaceships will both accelerate in the same manner so that they are always traveling at the same velocity according to einstein and the distance d between the ships never changes according to einstein the question is does the string between the ships break some people might argue that the string will not break because the distance between the two ships does not change according to einstein others will argue that the string does break because once the string starts moving it will undergo length contraction and that it will become too short to cover the distance d between the ships and snap so which argument is correct does the string break or not let's first examine this problem with accelerating spaceships in newtonian physics you should already know that in newtonian mechanics an object traveling with constant acceleration travels in a parabola curve which looks like this on a space-time diagram now let's look at a pair of spaceships that are stationary some distance d apart if the spaceships start accelerating to the right with the same acceleration then their world lines in space-time would look like this the parabolic world line of the blue spaceship in front is an exact copy of the parabolic world line of the orange spaceship in the back just shifted to the right in the space-time diagram a stationary observer would see the distance d between the spaceships remain the same throughout their journey and since this is newtonian physics time and space are absolute quantities that everyone agrees on this means that all observers agree the distance between the spaceships stays the same now let's consider accelerating spaceships in special relativity remember from the previous video an object traveling with constant proper acceleration and special relativity travels on a hyperbolic curve which approaches the speed of light but never reaches it let's again look at a pair of stationary spaceships that are some distance d apart if both spaceships start traveling to the right with the same proper acceleration then their world lines are hyperbolas that are exact copies of each other with the front ship's world line shifted to the right compared to the backshift's world line once again a stationary observer would see the distance d between the spaceships remain the same throughout their journey however this is now special relativity and distances are now relative recall in the last video that we said a curved world line measures time and space using a different space-time basis at every point along the curve where the time basis is tangent to the curve and the spatial basis vectors are orthogonal to it according to these instantaneous reference frames of the rear spaceship the distance between the ships becomes greater than d the ships are moving farther and farther apart from each other according to the rear spaceship now let's change things slightly let's say that we want the spaceships to remain the same distance d apart in their own reference frame even as they are accelerating so the blue spaceship in front must always be a distance d in front of the orange spaceship in the back then the front ship's new world line would look like this it is no longer an exact copy of the rear spaceship's world line in fact it is less curved this means that in order to maintain a constant distance d between the ships and their own reference frames the orange ship at the back must accelerate harder than the blue ship in front because of this a stationary observer will see the orange ship at the back catching up with the blue ship in the front with the distance between the ships getting smaller and smaller even though the two ships see themselves at a constant distance apart in their own reference frames so in the first scenario where the stationary observer sees a constant distance between the ships with equal proper acceleration the observers on the ships see themselves moving apart and so a string between them that's moving along with the ships would break but in the second scenario where the ship at the back accelerates harder to maintain a constant proper distance between the ships the string doesn't snap because the distance between the ships doesn't change the stationary observer sees the distance between the ships gets smaller and smaller this is the resolution to bell's spaceship paradox the string will break if the ships accelerate with the same proper acceleration but if the ship in the back accelerates harder in just the right way the distance between the ships stays the same in their own reference frames so the string doesn't break we can use the idea of maintaining the same distance between accelerating spaceships and their own reference frame to create a curvilinear coordinate system called rindler coordinates rindler coordinates show us how time and space are viewed from the perspective of an observer that is traveling with constant proper acceleration this means that render coordinates are a space-time coordinate system for a non-inertial frame of reference to create the coordinate system an observer on an accelerating spaceship needs to know how to measure distances in front of and behind them instead of looking at two accelerating spaceships let's look at a whole train of accelerating spaceships each ship will maintain a constant distance d from each ship in front of and behind it in the previous video we derived the equations for the hyperbolic world line of the first of these spaceships where the time ct is given by a hyperbolic sine and position x is given by a hyperbolic cosine the hyperbolic angle is given by the proper acceleration alpha divided by the speed of light c times the proper time tau for reasons that will come up later i'm going to rewrite this hyperbolic angle as alpha over c squared times c times tau this spaceship accelerates with proper acceleration alpha and maintains a constant distance c squared over alpha from the origin behind it which is also the rindler horizon we know that this distance is constant because when we calculate the space time interval s squared which is ct squared minus x squared and then take the square root of its negative value we get a constant proper length c squared over alpha i may sometimes write the equations of motion for an accelerated observer using d instead of c squared over alpha d is the distance between the first spaceship and the rindler horizon at the origin and it's a convenient unit of distance to use when talking about distance in riddler coordinates i don't know if this distance d has an official name so i'm just going to call it the rindler distance we know that the proper acceleration is alpha because we can calculate the for acceleration vector a by taking two time derivatives with respect to tau and then taking the negative square root of a dot a and we get alpha so given that the distance between the rocket and the rindler horizon is capital d let's say that we want another accelerating rocket that maintains the same constant distance d from the first rocket in other words the second rocket must undergo proper acceleration and maintain a distance 2d from the rendler horizon we can do this by taking the equations of motion for the first rocket and dividing the proper acceleration alpha by 2. this means that the proper distance from the origin is now twice as big 2 times c squared over alpha or 2d as desired the 4 velocity dotted with itself u dot u is c squared as required and the proper acceleration the square root of negative a dot a is now half as big alpha over two so as we said before in order for two accelerating spaceships to maintain a constant proper distance from each other the spaceship in the back must accelerate harder alpha in this case and the spaceship in front does not accelerate as hard alpha over two in this case we can continue this pattern to get spaceships traveling with proper acceleration alpha over three alpha over four alpha over 5 and so on all of these spaceships maintain a constant proper distance d from each other but each spaceship must accelerate harder than the spaceships in front of it when we have a collection of particles that accelerate together in such a way that the proper distances between them do not change we call this born rigid motion after the physicist max born and again note that all of these spaceships have a common rindler horizon located at the origin we can take this collection of world lines for accelerating spaceships and use them to build a curvilinear coordinate system for space-time taking the equations for constant proper acceleration let's replace the coefficient in front c squared over alpha with a continuous variable x tilde the x tilde variable lets us continuously choose a hyperbola with any constant proper distance from the origin of our choice with this constant proper distance from the origin just being x tilde we can also replace the expression c times proper time tau with a new time coordinate c t tilde this time acts as a hyperbolic angle for the coordinate system and lets us pick a particular instant in time for all of the spaceships these new coordinates ct tilde and x-tilde form a curvilinear coordinate system that indicates how time and space are observed from the point of view of an accelerated observer with constant proper acceleration alpha and whose render horizon is at the origin unlike the standard space-time coordinates the rindler coordinate system only covers a portion of our space-time diagram since accelerated observers cannot see anything beyond their rendler horizon the rindler horizon line represents a line where the hyperbolic angle ct tilde approaches positive infinity this lower diagonal line does not represent a horizon because light can cross through it but it still represents a boundary of the coordinate system where ct tilde approaches negative infinity so now we have equations that change between the standard space-time coordinates ct and x and the new rindler coordinates ct tilde and x-tilde in some ways this is similar to the lorentz transformations we've seen before which also convert between two sets of space-time coordinates the difference is this time the new rindler coordinates are curvilinear coordinates and the transformation cannot be represented by a matrix multiplication in this next part of the video i'm going to state various properties of the rindler coordinates that will help us understand how accelerated observers view space-time in particular i'm going to show that all clocks on the different accelerating spaceships will tick at different rates in other words each spaceship measures a different proper time from the others i'll also calculate the proper acceleration for each spaceship and finally i will show that the formula for the space-time interval s squared from the origin does not depend on time at the end of this video i'll talk about how the speed of light can have values other than c in riddler coordinates the curves of constant x tilde are the curves of constant position according to an accelerated observer these curves are a series of hyperbolic curves that all have the same render horizon at the origin hyperbolas that are separated by equal proper distances at one point in time will maintain that same proper distance from each other for all time just like the spaceships we saw before the time coordinate ct tilde increases moving upward the curves of constant ct tilde are actually straight lines that radiate from the origin these are the lines of constant time these show us where all the spaceships are located at any given moment along their journey it's important to note that the t tilde coordinate is not the proper time tau this means that t tilde is not the time measured by a clock on the spaceship traveling along a given hyperbola the proper time tau measured by a particle on a hyperbola of constant x tilde is actually given by tau equals alpha over c squared times x tilde times t tilde or equivalently tau equals x tilde over the rindler distance d times t tilde i'll give a formal proof of this fact in relativity 105 part d when i discuss proper time along curves but here is some quick informal reasoning for it recall that given the equations of motion for the first accelerating spaceship with distance d from the origin we got the equations of motion for the ship located at 2d by replacing alpha with alpha over 2 in the equations if we rewrite c squared over alpha as d this is the same thing as replacing d with 2d if we compare the equations of the second ship to our general rendler hyperbolas we can see that ct tilde over d corresponds to c times proper time tau over 2d canceling the c's and the d's we get that two times t tilde equals proper time tau but we can also see that x tilde corresponds with 2d so this factor of 2 is really the ratio between x tilde and d subbing this in we get that the proper time tau for any spaceship of any position is x tilde over d times t tilde so given this formula for proper time along curves of constant x tilde this means that clocks located at larger x-tilde values will tick more quickly if we look at our five accelerating spaceships on a line of simultaneity t tilde equals one second we find that each spaceship has counted a different proper time on its clock even though all of these events happen at a simultaneous time for all the ships we find the ships at larger x tilde values have measured longer proper times on their clocks it's important to remember that the t-tilde coordinate is equal to the proper time only for the first spaceship at x tilde equals d and nowhere else all the other spaceships will measure different proper times according to this equation also the proper acceleration alpha is a parameter for the rindler coordinates there are actually several different versions of rendler coordinates each with a different value for the alpha parameter particles on a world line of constant x tilde will have a proper acceleration of c squared over x tilde which is also equal to alpha times d over x tilde to prove this recall on world lines of constant x tilde that proper time tau equals x tilde over d times t tilde we can use this to prove that d tau by dt tilde is x tilde over d since x tilde is constant and taking the reciprocal of both sides we get that dt tilde by d tau is d over x tilde if we start with the ct formula for rindler coordinates and take the derivative with respect to proper time we turn the cinch into a cosh and get a c over d term outside we also get a dt tilde by d tau chain rule term we don't take the derivative with respect to x tilde because we assume x tilde is a constant another derivative turns kosh back into cinch and we get another c over d and another chain rule derivative term subbing in d over x tilde for the chain rule term we can see that the d's cancel out and we can also cancel one x tilde and we end up with c squared over x tilde out in front we can calculate the second derivative of x in a similar way and calculating the proper acceleration the square root of negative a dot a we get c squared over x tilde which is also alpha times d over x tilde this formula basically means that the proper acceleration of each spaceship decreases as x tilde increases which matches what we've seen we showed in relativity 104 part e that the lorentz transformation does not change the form of the formula for the space-time interval s squared all inertial frames calculate s squared by taking the time coordinate squared minus the space coordinates squared but if we substitute in the rindler coordinates for ct and x into the formula for s squared we see that the formula for s squared in the rindler coordinates has a different form that doesn't involve the time coordinate at all this is because the rindler coordinates are not obtained with a lorentz transformation and rindler coordinates represent a non-inertial frame so the formula for the space-time interval looks different than what we're used to for inertial frames since the space-time interval s-squared doesn't depend on the time coordinate ct tilde this means that the space-time interval doesn't change with time for any of the spaceships traveling along the hyperbolas and since the space-time interval is always a negative number negative x-tilde squared this confirms that x tilde is the proper distance from the origin at any point in the rindler coordinate system each hyperbola is a curve of constant x tilde and so it has a constant proper distance from the origin or the rendler horizon as i stated before the render coordinates are only valid for a portion of the space-time diagram they only work for positive x and when ct is between negative x and positive x in the standard coordinates now these equations are a bit inconvenient because they are mostly useful for changing from riddler coordinates c t tilde and x tilde to the standard coordinates c t and x it's possible to invert these formulas to come up with new equations that change from the standard coordinates c t and x to render coordinates c d tilde and x tilde we've already seen that the space time interval which is ct squared minus x squared in the standard coordinates is minus x tilde squared in riddler coordinates if we multiply both sides of the equation by negative 1 and take the square root we get a convenient formula for x tilde in terms of ct and x we take the positive value of the square root since the riddler coordinates work in the positive x tilde direction also if we divide the formula for c t by the formula for x we see that the x tildes cancel and sine h divided by cos h is just the definition of hyperbolic tangent tange we can eliminate tange by using its inverse function arctange on both sides and then multiply both sides by c squared over alpha to solve for c t tilde we now have formulas that convert from the standard coordinates to render coordinates and back again to summarize this video we learned about bell's spaceship paradox if a set of spaceships accelerate together with the same proper acceleration then the distance between the spaceships is constant when viewed from a rest frame however in the frames of the spaceships themselves the spaceships will appear to be moving apart conversely if the spaceships accelerate in such a way that the proper distance between them remains constant in their own frames then each ship will have a different proper acceleration the ship in the back will have to accelerate harder in order to keep up with the ship in the front in this case the stationary observer observes the spaceships moving closer and closer together both spaceships will have a common rindler horizon behind them in order to look at space and time from the perspective of someone undergoing constant proper acceleration we derived the riddler coordinates which are curvilinear coordinates for space time a traveler on a constant x tilde coordinate will have a constant proper acceleration of c squared over x tilde the proper time for a traveler with constant x tilde coordinate is alpha over c squared times x tilde times t tilde we also saw that the formula for the space time interval s squared was just negative x tilde squared which is different than the formula that we're used to seeing in inertial frames we also derived formulas to convert between the standard coordinates and the rindler coordinates in both directions the last thing i want to mention is that in rindler coordinates it's possible that the speed of light can be less than c or greater than c where c is the speed of light in an inertial reference frame however it's important to note that the truth of this statement comes down to the definition of speed as dx tilde by dt tilde which is not an invariant based on four vectors and so different observers will disagree on it the reason that this definition leads to the speed of light not being c is because t tilde is not equal to the proper time tau in riddler coordinates except in the special case of an observer that is located at the rindler distance d this observer will always measure the speed of light to be c when measuring light beams locally right next to them the calculation of the speed of light to be not equal to c occurs for non-local regions of space-time far from this observer where the t-tilde coordinate does not equal the proper time tau in the future with non-inertial coordinate systems and in general relativity we will need to be very careful when interpreting space-time coordinates because unlike with inertial frames the space-time coordinates will not always have obvious physical meaning so given the spaceships in the rindler coordinates let's find the speed of light in the render coordinates dx tilde by dt tilde at various positions along the horizontal axis the equations of these light beams in the inertial coordinates are x equals c t plus x naught where x naught determines the initial position of the light beam along the x-axis i'm going to go through this derivation quickly so pause the video if you want to look at it more carefully we know that the rindler x tilde coordinate squared equals x squared minus ct squared in inertial coordinates we can sub in the equation of our light beam ct plus x naught for the x variable we can expand the square cancel c t squared and bring all the terms to one side and replace c t with x tilde times cinch of ct tilde over the rindler distance d since this is just a quadratic in terms of x tilde we can use the quadratic formula to solve for x tilde this one half cancels with this two and the two squared and four under the square root sign we can also factor out x naught to the front of the expression the fundamental hyperbolic trig identity tells us that one plus cinch squared equals cos squared and we're going to enforce that x tilde is positive to get the positive square root sign it can also be shown that cinch plus cosh equals the exponential of the hyperbolic angle so we have a formula for x tilde and if we take the derivative with respect to t tilde we get c over d times x naught times this exponential if we restrict this formula to the horizontal axis where ct tilde equals zero then we get the speed of light is c over d times the initial position x naught this means that a beam of light sent from the rindler distance d has a speed c a beam of light sent from the position 2d has a speed 2c a light beam sent from 3d has speed 3c and a light beam sent from 4d has speed 4c also a light beam sent from one half d has speed one half c and a light beam sent from the rindler horizon at the origin has zero speed as we discussed in the last video so on the horizontal axis at the rindler distance d the speed of light in riddler coordinates dx tilde by dt tilde is equal to c as we can see this light beam travels one grid unit of distance in one grid unit of time in this grid box for distances less than the render distance d the speed of light is less than c a beam of light travels less than one grid unit of distance and one grid unit of time and for distances greater than d the speed of light is greater than c a beam of light travels more than one grid unit of distance in one grid unit of time so this idea that the speed of light might not be equal to c can seem pretty confusing so how do we interpret this remember the second postulate of special relativity says that the speed of light in a vacuum c is the same in all inertial frames this means that in an inertial frame right beside a light beam the frame will always measure light as having a speed of c so whether we're in a global inertial frame or an instantaneous inertial frame at one instant along a curved world line we'll measure the speed of light right beside us to have speed c and what we're really saying here is that the derivative of proper length with respect to proper time at a given point is always c for a light beam's world line where the proper length and the proper time are measured according to inertial frames however it's very important to realize that the clocks in non-inertial frames can tick at different rates this means that non-local beams of light can have a speed different from c because its speed is being measured with a non-local clock mathematically this means that the derivative of proper length with respect to proper time for a light beam is not necessarily equal to the derivative of the space coordinate with respect to the time coordinate for a non-inertial coordinate system let's visualize this with space-time diagrams in inertial coordinates we know that along lines of constant position the proper time tau is just equal to the coordinate time t so if we place clocks tau one tau two and tau three at various positions and set them all equal to zero then at this line of simultaneity a bit later the clocks all read the same value of one so in inertial coordinates the coordinate time t is equal to the proper time tau if we remain at a constant position and this is the same time measured for all positions x however in riddler coordinates we know that along curves of constant x tilde the proper time along each curve depends on the position x tilde so if we start clocks tau 1 tau 2 and tau 3 at 0 at various positions then at this next line of simultaneity they will all read different times because more proper time passes at larger x tilde positions clocks in riddler coordinates will tick at different rates depending on their position and so the coordinate time t tilde is not always equal to the proper time tau for a given location [Music] it's also worth mentioning that in global inertial frames the position coordinate is equal to the proper length along lines of constant time and this is also true in the rindler coordinates as well the important thing to note is that the coordinate time t tilde is not equal to the proper time in riddler coordinates if we return to our five spaceships along the line of simultaneity at t tilde equals one the first spaceship at position d counts a proper time of one on their clock but according to our formula the fourth spaceship at position 4d counts four units of proper time on their clock a beam of light next to the first spaceship will have a speed in render coordinates of dx tilde by dt tilde which is just d l naught by d tau one which is the ship's local proper time as stated before the local speed of light in an instantaneous inertial frame is always c if we measure the local speed of light at the fourth spaceship using the local proper time tau4 we also get a speed of c because this is also an instantaneous inertial frame however if we measure this light beam at the fourth spaceship using the riddler coordinates dx tilde by dt tilde we're not measuring this light beam using a local clock since one unit of t tilde time is only equal to a quarter of the local proper time tau 4 on the fourth rocket the result is that we get the speed of the light beam to be 4c because it was measured with a non-local clock so the important points to remember for non-inertial frames are that the space-time coordinates don't always have obvious physical meaning it's possible that the coordinate time is not always equal to proper time along lines of constant position and it's possible that the coordinate position is not always equal to proper length along lines of constant time therefore the local speed of light beams is not always equal to the coordinate speeds of light beams measured non-locally now all of this might seem pretty confusing to understand this better we're going to study the jacobian matrix and the rindler metric for getting proper time along curves in the next couple videos
