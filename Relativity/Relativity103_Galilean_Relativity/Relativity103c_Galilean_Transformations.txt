welcome back to relativity 103 Galilean relativity in this video we're going to move on to the Galilean transform which is how we change our basis in space-time diagrams for Galilean relativity we've seen that in Galilean relativity observers in different reference frames will agree on time but they will disagree on position for example if we look at this green event point on the spacetime diagram according to Einstein's reference frame this will happen to time units into the future and one space unit to the right compared to the origin from the planes point of view the green event point is two time units into the future and nine space units to the right from the cars point of view it happens two time units into the future and zero space units away this is because the event happens to be right on top of the cars world line so the position of the event is equal to the cars position why it happens so we can measure the time and space coordinates manually by looking at the space-time diagram but it would be nice if there was an equation that could do the coordinate conversions for us so let's try to find equations for the cars time and position components calculated from Einsteins time and position components we know that in Galilean relativity time is universal and so the time for the car is equal to the time for the scientist Einstein and I'm going to refer to Einstein as man in the variable subscript just because it's a short word that's easy to write but what about the position coordinates we can start by noting that the speed of the car and Einstein's reference frame is 1/2 space units to the right for every time unit at the origin Einstein and the car are at the same position after one time unit their spatial separation is 1/2 after 2 time units their separation is 1 after 3 time units their separation is 1 and 1/2 and so on and so forth the separation Delta X between Einstein and the car is 1/2 multiplied by time where 1/2 is just the speed of the car so the cars position coordinate is equal to Einstein's position coordinate minus 1/2 times time if you're wondering why I used a minus sign instead of a plus sign just remember that the cars position according to Einstein is 1/2 1 1 and 1/2 2 and so on but the cars position according to itself is always zero so we need to subtract off this separation in order to measure position from the cars perspective now if I just wanted to teach you Galilean relativity I could just tell you that this is the Galilean transform and say that's the end of it however I'm assuming that you want to learn general relativity in the long term so we're going to need to study the Galilean transform more deeply I want you to remember that basis vectors and vector components are two sides of the same coin anytime we're dealing with vectors we need to think about both the basis vectors and the components it doesn't make sense to talk about one without talking about the other so the Galilean transform isn't just about changing components that's only half the story the Galilean transform changes both the basis vectors and the vector components and they change in opposite ways in relativity 102 I showed that if we took the basis e^x and ey and measured this pencil to have components 1 1 if we doubled the length of the basis vectors the components would become 1/2 1/2 we saw that the basis vectors and vector components behaved in opposite ways when the basis vectors grow the components shrink for this reason we call basis vectors covariant and we call vector components contravariant vector components do the contrary or opposite things that basis vectors do I'd like to show you how the Galilean transform affects the basis vectors which are covariant as well as the vector components which are contravariant we learned in the last video that every inertial frame has its own space-time basis where the time vector is angled to align with the frames worldline we're going to find that knowing how do you change from the scientists space-time basis to the cars space-time basis will result in the coordinate change formulas that we need so let's start with the scientists space-time basis and see if we can convert it into the cars space-time basis so we're going to try and build the cars basis vectors out of these scientists basis vectors so what would the cars time vector et Tilda be equal to if we needed to build it out of ET and e^x well it looks like we need 1 ET vector and 1/2 of an e X vector so I'll write in the components 1 and 1/2 and what about the e x tilde vector well it looks like e^x tilde is exactly equal to e^x so we need 0 ET and 1 e X to build e^x tilde to make things simpler I'm going to leave out the ones in this formula and get rid of the term with the zero in it so we have successfully come up with the formulas that let us convert Einsteins space-time basis into the cars space-time basis now let's try and go in the other direction where we use the cars space-time basis to build up Einsteins space-time basis to build the ET vector it looks like we need 1 ET tilde and 1/2 of e^x tilde but pointing in the opposite direction so the components of ET and the cars basis are 1 and negative 1/2 and again since e^x is exactly equal to e X tilde to build e^x we need 0 et Tilda's and exactly 1 e x tilde and again removing the ones and getting rid of the zero term we get this so we now have equations to switch back and forth between Einsteins basis and the cars basis you'll notice that this first set of formulas has a positive 1/2 and the other set has a negative 1/2 this is because the equations are opposites of each other if we start with Einsteins basis then change to the cars basis and then change back again we should end up with what we started with I'll show you what this means in terms of the math we'll start with the equation for ET in terms of the cars space-time basis then let's replace ET tilde and X tilde with the formulas from this box notice that the positive 1/2 e X and the negative 1/2 e X cancel out and we're left with ET equals ET so applying the car to Man equations and then applying the men to car equations brings us back to where we started since the equations are opposites now let's go through a simple example for how to change space-time components using these change of basis equations so we know that the S vector is made up of three time vectors and for space vectors in einstein's frame now let's use the change of basis equations to get the components for the cars reference frame we can use substitution to replace ET and e^x using these equations containing ET tilde and X tilde we can distribute the three here to get three ET and negative 1.5 e x and if we add negative one point five and four we get two point five so we can see that the components of the vector in the frame of the car are three time units and two point five space units which matches up with our space-time diagram so we successfully changed coordinates in one specific case here but we should try and get formulas that work for all cases for any vector the first thing I'll do is replace the velocity one half for the car with a generic velocity V and these formulas let's start with a generic space-time vector s equals t ET plus x e^x in Einstein's reference frame then we replace e^x + ET using these change-of-basis equations then we distribute the T here to get te T tilde minus V te x tilde then since both of these are terms with the X tilde basis vector we can rewrite it as a single component negative VT plus X now since this formula is written in terms of the cars space-time basis ET tilde and X tilde this means that the components are just equal to T tilde the time according to the car and X tilde the position according to the car so we now have equations for changing between the Manns components and the cars components T tilde equals T because time is universal and position X tilde equals negative VT plus X just like we saw before we just take the man's position and subtract off the change in the car's position due to its velocity we can also do the same thing in Reverse and start with a vector in the cars basis with components T tilde and X tilde and then use these equations to replace the basis vectors ET tilde and e^x tilde we distribute the T tilde and since both of these terms contain e^x we can combine them and write the component V T tilde plus X tilde but since this is written in terms of the Einstein space-time basis these components are just T and X so we can write the equations T equals T tilde and x equals V T tilde plus X tilde so we've discovered these four sets of formulas for changing between the basis vectors and the vector components for the man and the car and the Galilean transform is really all of these formulas put together earlier I mentioned that the two formulas for the basis vectors are opposites because there's a plus V here and a minus V here that means that if we use one set of formulas and then the other we end up back where we started the formulas for changing components are also opposites there's a minus V here and a plus V here and you can check for yourself that if we use one set of formulas and then the other we end up back where we started with the original variables being equal to themselves now what might be less obvious is why we have a plus V here for changing the basis from the man to the car and we have a minus V here for changing the components from the man to the car and the reason for this change in sign is covariance and contravariance remember that basis vectors are covariant and vector components are contravariant which means they do the opposite thing that basis vectors do what's happening is that the plus V term here is pushing the ET tilde basis vector to lean more in the positive horizontal direction and that's why it's slanted meanwhile this minus V is pushing the X tilde component more in the negative direction in Einstein's frame the position a component of this event is 2 but in the cars frame the position component has been pulled toward the negative direction and is just 1 because this event is closer to the cars world line compared to Einsteins world line the position component for the car is smaller so that's why the change of basis and the change of component formulas are opposites the plus V here pushes the e tilde basis vector in the positive direction and the minus V here pushes the X tilde component in the negative direction the opposite direction so the stuff I've explained in this video about opposite formulas and covariance and contravariance might seem hard to understand right now but all of it becomes much easier to understand if we write these equations in matrix array notation so let's try writing the change of basis equations from the men to the car in array notation I've added the 1 and zeros back in so we can see exactly what all the components are it turns out that to rewrite these equations in matrix notation we write the row et2 the e^x tilde equals the Rho ete x times this matrix which is called a Galilean matrix we can confirm that this is correct by doing the matrix multiplications and making sure we get these formulas when we're done so when we do this row times this column we just use the rules of first times first to get 1 et and second times second to get ve X and since this is equal to the first element in this row ET tilde we've confirmed this matches with this equation next if we do this row times the second column we do first times first to get 0 ET and second times second to get 1 e^x since this is equal to the second entry of this row e x tilde we've confirmed that this matches this equation here we can do the same thing for the formulas that change components from the man to the car this time we get the column of vector components T tilde X tilde equals a galilean matrix multiplied by the column T X notice that this galilean matrix has a minus V because of the minus V in the original formulas so we've written the equations in matrix form but you might still be a little bit confused about why we write the basis vectors as rows and why we write the vector components as columns and also why this galilean matrix has a plus V and why this galilean matrix has a minus V it turns out that these two Galilean matrices are inverses what we multiply them we get the identity matrix right when we multiply this row by this column we get 1 times 1 plus 0 times negative V which is just 1 and you can check for yourself that if we multiply all the other rows and columns together we just end up with the identity matrix and this is why this is so important if we start with the space time vector s written in Einstein spaces as te t + x X we can write this in array notation using a row of basis vectors times a column of vector components then we can insert an identity matrix in the middle here since multiplying by the identity matrix doesn't change anything it's a bit like multiplying by the number 1 but now we can split this identity matrix into two Galilean matrices that are inverses of each other one with the positive V and one with the negative V since they're inverses they multiply to give the identity matrix and so we still haven't changed anything and now we can see very clearly that the first Galilean matrix with the positive V is multiplying the vector basis whereas the second Galilean matrix with the negative V is multiplying the column of components and it's doing the opposite thing or the contravariant thing because it has this minus V here and if we check our change of basis equations we can see that this multiplication just gives us the cars of space-time basis written in a row and this multiplication just gives us the cars components written in a column so this shows that the vector S is invariant we can write it in Einstein's basis or in the cars basis both formulas are equal to each other just written using different points of view the reason that they're both equal is because basis vectors are covariant and changed using one Galilean matrix and the vector components are contravariant and change with the inverse Galilean matrix when the basis does one thing the vector components do the other thing the opposite changes balance out so that things are still equal and we can also convert the other equations that change from the car to the man into array notation the rows of basis vector transform with this Galilean matrix using the minus V and the columns of vector components transform with this Galilean matrix with the positive B so here we have all four formulas for the Galilean transform in array notation so let's sum up everything we've learned about the Galilean transform we know that the change of basis equation and the change of component equation use opposite or inverse Galilean matrices because of covariance and contravariance when basis vectors do one thing the vector components do the opposite thing that's why the V and the basis equation and the V and the component equation have opposite signs this is what allows us to start with a vector written in one basis insert an identity matrix and then change the basis using one Galilean matrix and change the components using the opposite Galilean matrix the opposite changes or opposite Galilean matrices will balance out allowing us to rewrite the vector in a different frame of reference also the two change of basis equations also use inverse Galilean matrices one with the positive V and one with the negative B this is because if we use one and then the other we end up back where we started and remember basis vectors are covariant so we write them as rows and place them on the left of the Galilean matrix the two change of component equations also use inverse Galilean matrices for the same reason if we use one and then the other we should end up back where we started and remember vector components are contravariant so we write them as columns and place them on the right of the Galilean matrix so to understand the Galilean transform just remember that the Galilean transform changes both the basis vectors and the vector components and even though there are four formulas here if we understand how the Galilean matrix changes one basis we can automatically figure out the Galilean matrices for the other three formulas just by knowing that we can invert the matrix by changing the sign of V in the next video all discuss the Euclidean metric tensor which is a tool for measuring the lengths of vectors
