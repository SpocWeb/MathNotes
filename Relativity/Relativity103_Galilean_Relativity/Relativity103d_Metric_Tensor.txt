welcome to the final topic in relativity 103 Galilean relativity we're going to discuss the Euclidean metric tensor which is a mathematical tool for measuring distances much later in this video series we'll discover that the metric tensor is responsible for black holes the expansion of the universe gravitational waves and more you can see the metric tensor here in the Einstein field equations denoted by a lowercase G we're still far away from understanding these equations but this video will give you your first step to understanding the metric tensor as I said the metric tensor is a mathematical tool for measuring distances so far in relativity 103 we've been talking a lot about space-time diagrams where we measure both space and time in Galilean relativity there is not a sensible way to measure distances in space-time so in this video we're going to focus on measuring distances in 2d space measured with the x and y variables let's say that we have this pencil sitting in the 2d plane and we want to find out how long it is we can think of this pencil as a vector R which written in terms of the basis vectors is equal to 1 e x + 2 ey you'll notice that this pencil is the longest side of a right angle triangle where the other two sides are parallel to the e ex and ey vectors if we label the lengths of the shorter sides of the triangle as a and B and label the length of the longest side as C because this is a right angle triangle we can use Pythagoras theorem and write down the equation a squared plus B squared equals C squared this means that the length of the pencil C is equal to the square root of a squared plus B squared in this case a is just the horizontal component of the vector which is 1 and B is just the vertical component of the vector which is 2 1 squared is 1 and 2 squared is 4 so this means that C is equal to the square root of 5 which is also the length of the vector are and the length of the pencil so we calculated the length of the pencil to be the square root of five but that was using the exe y basis let's try calculating the length of the pencil in another basis like e^x tilde and ey tilde where the basis vectors are twice as long the components of the vector in this basis are 1/2 and 1 and if we plug in these values for a and B in the Pythagoras theorem formula we get the square root of 1/2 squared plus 1 squared which is the square root of 1/4 plus 1 or the square root of 5 over 4 this is also equal to 1/2 the square root of 5 now let's try this other vector basis where the components of the pencil are 1 and 1 and subbing these numbers into a and B we calculate the length of the pencil to be the square root of 2 so there is a problem here this formula from Pythagoras theorem gives us different answers when we use different basis vectors in the second case the answer is half as big as it should be and in the third case the triangle formed by the pencil and the basis vector isn't even a right-angled triangle so the Pythagoras formula gives us a very strange answer so unfortunately the formula a squared plus B squared equals C squared has failed us and we need a better way to measure lengths and the solution is to instead calculate the squared magnitude of a vector R using the dot product of R with itself so let's try recalculating the length of the pencil using this formula we'll start with our first basis e^x and ey which is an orthonormal basis this means that the basis vectors are perpendicular to each other and both have a length of 1 this means that exe ex and ey ey are both 1 since the basis vectors have length 1 and exe Y is 0 since the basis vectors are perpendicular also called orthogonal so given some generic vector R equal to X X plus y ey let's compute the squared magnitude of R using our R this is just X X plus y ey dotted with itself and we can use the rule for distributing multiplying the first outer inner and last terms to get these four terms containing basis vector dot products the ext Y term goes to 0 because the basis vectors are orthogonal and so does exe Y because the order of the dot product doesn't matter also exe X is 1 and so is ey ey so we end up with the formula x squared plus y squared which is very similar to the equation from Pythagoras theorem C squared equals a squared plus B squared so let's take the formula x squared plus y squared and sub in the X component of R which is 1 and also the Y component of R which is 2 we get 1 squared plus 2 squared which is 1 plus 4 which is 5 so the length of R is the square root of 5 which is the correct answer that we got last time now let's look at the basis where the basis vectors are twice as long ax tilde equals to e ex and ey tilde equals to ey to compute e X tilde X tilde we can replace it with 2e x dot 2e X which is 4 times e^x DX and since e^x DX is 1 because e^x is a normal vector with length 1 we get 4 as the result we can use the same substitution trick for e^x tilde Y tilde and since e^x + ey are orthogonal this goes to 0 and finally with E Y tilde Y Y tilde since e yd Y is 1 this result is also 4 so we have all the necessary dot products listed here now let's compute RR which is equal to X tilde Y X tilde plus y tilde ie y tilde dotted with itself again distributing the terms to get the first outer inner and last products we get four terms px tilde Y y tilde goes to 0 and so does a Y tilde X tilde and the other dot products are both equal to four so we get a final formula of four X tilde squared plus four Y tilde squared now let's sub in the components of our in this basis into the formula for the squared length of our we use 1/2 for X tilde and one for y tilde 1/2 squared is 1/4 + 1 squared is just 1 so we get 1 plus 4 which is 5 this means that the length of the our vector is the square root of 5 and this agrees with the answer we got in the previous basis now let's try this final basis where the basis vector e^x has this smile shape on top of it exc Lizz equal to 1 e x plus 1 ey and ey smile is just equal to ey the dot product of e X smile with itself is 1 ax plus 1 ey dotted with itself if we distribute this out we get four terms the middle terms go away because they have dot products that go to 0 meanwhile the other dot products go to 1 and adding up the results we add e^x smile DX smile is equal to 2 now let's do X smile dotted with E Y smile this expands to 2 terms and this goes to 0 and this goes to 1 so the final result is 1 and the last dot product is just e Y dy which is 1 so we have all the necessary dot products in this basis now let's compute the formula for the squared length of which is our our and we again distribute this out to get four terms and these dot products become to one one and one this gives us the formula 2x smile squared plus 2x smile I smile plus y smile squared notice that I added these two terms together since they are both just a product of X smile and Y smile so that's why there's a 2 in front here so let's take this formula for the squared length of R and let's sub in 1 for the X component and 1 for the Y component and carrying out these multiplications we get 2 plus 2 plus 1 which is 5 and so the length of R is the square root of 5 which is consistent with all our other answers so as we've learned when measuring lengths we can't just use the familiar formula a squared plus B squared equals C squared from elementary school the real way to get the squared length of a vector R is to take the dot product of R with itself then expand the R vector in a vector basis and then distribute over the dot product the key to getting the correct formula is to remember to calculate all these dot products properly we can't just assume that they're 1 or 0 this formula only becomes the familiar Pythagoras's formula in the special case of an orthonormal basis but in any other basis we need to pay attention to these dot products and the formula for the squared length of a vector can also be written in matrix notation like this with the vector components in this row and this column and this matrix of dot products in the middle this matrix of basis vector dot products is called the metric tensor matrix the metric tensor matrix components are also sometimes written with the lowercase letter G for example the component G X X is equal to the dot product of e X and E X so I'd like to take every thing we've seen so far and tie it back to the idea of invariance the squared length of the vector R has different formulas when we work in different coordinate systems but the results are always equal and invariant and when writing things in array notation the metric tensor matrix has different components when we use different coordinate systems but we will always calculate the length of a vector to be the same in all cases even if we use different coordinate systems this is a little bit like how the vector components of the pencil are different when we use different basis vectors even if the pencil itself is the same and invariant similarily the components inside the metric tensor matrix are different when we use different basis vectors but the metric tensor itself is invariant and unchanging the metric tensor itself is actually a function that takes two vectors as inputs and returns their dot product as the output the dot product of two vectors R and T does not depend on the coordinate system this means that the metric tensor function is invariant and doesn't depend on the coordinate system the metric tensor matrix will have different numbers in different coordinate systems but so will the vector components of RN T so the result are T which is the same as the function output G of R and T is the same in all coordinates now I've mentioned several times before that vector components are contravariant if we measure the components of the pencil to be 1:1 in this basis if we double the length of the basis vectors the components shrank to 1/2 1/2 when the basis vectors get bigger the vector components get smaller and that's why vector components are contravariant because they do the opposite thing that basis vectors do it's also worth asking the same question about the metric tensor if the metric tensor in the first basis is equal to the identity matrix what happens to the metric tensor matrix when we double the length of the basis vectors is it going to be co variant or contravariant we can find this out by writing the metric tensor matrix in the e^x tilde and ey tilde basis then we'll rewrite all the basis vectors inside in terms of e^x and ey using these equations that relate the two bases so you can see that we have pairs of twos everywhere and we can bring them out in front to get 2 times 2 or 4 and we already know that the original basis is orthonormal so the dot products are 1 0 0 1 and so we see that the metric tensor matrix in the e^x tilde ey tilde basis has components 4 0 0 4 so when we double the lengths of the basis vectors the metric tensor matrix components x 4 in other words they doubled and then doubled again so the metric tensor is what we call twice covariant because when the basis vectors change the metric tensor matrix changes in the same way twice and this makes sense because every entry in the metric tensor matrix has two basis vectors in it so it makes sense that when the basis vectors change these matrix components will do that same change twice so that gives us some intuition as to why the metric tensor is twice covariant but let's see if we can prove it you've seen in previous videos that if the basis vectors change with this matrix a b c d then the basis vector components change with the opposite matrix a b c d inverse where the inverse is denoted by this minus 1 up here also if we change the basis in the reverse direction we also use the inverse of the ABCD matrix and if we reverse the component change we use the inverse of this matrix here and the inverse of the inverse is just the original matrix again so these two matrices here are the same now let's take a look at our array formula for the squared length of a vector and I'm going to take this row of vector components and rewrite it as a transpose of a column instead the transpose is denoted with this T symbol and it just tells us to take the column and flip it into a row now notice that we have an equation here for this XY column so I'm going to substitute in this array multiplication involving the ABCD matrix and the X tilde and Y tilde components into here and here and so we get this now it's a rule in linear algebra that when we have the transpose of an array multiplication like we do here this is equal to the multiplication of the transposes with the arrays written in the opposite order so you can see this ABCD matrix is now written on the right next to the metric tensor matrix and both this column and this matrix have transposes next notice that these columns have the X tilde Y tilde components in them and that means that all of this in the middle is equal to the metric tensor components in the basis for X tilde and Y tilde so this gives us an array multiplication formula for converting between the metric tensor components in different coordinate systems to get the metric tensor matrix in the ext Y tilde basis we just take the original metric tensor matrix and multiply it on either side by this ABCD matrix being sure to take the transpose on the left side here now notice that this ABCD matrix is used to change from the exp Y basis to the e X tilde a Y tilde basis this is the same ABCD matrix that changes the metric tensor matrix components from the first basis into the tilde basis and this ABCD matrix is used twice therefore the metric tensor matrix is twice covariant when we change coordinate systems the metric tensor matrix does what the basis vectors do but it does it twice which is why we have two matrices and if we wanted to change the components in the other direction we use the inverse of the ABCD matrix on either side here this also helps explain why the length of a vector is invariant when we change the coordinates the two sets of vector components each change contravariant Li but the metric tensor changes twice covariantly the two covariant changes cancel out with the two contravariant changes which ensures the result of the formula doesn't change so let's sum up what we've learned about the metric tensor we learned that when we want to get the length of a vector we can't just use the formula a squared plus B squared equals C squared instead we calculate the length of a vector R by computing the dot product R R when we expand our in terms of basis vectors and then distribute over the dot product we get a bunch of terms which we can then write in array notation like this this matrix of basis vector dot products is called the metric tensor matrix and its components are sometimes written using a lowercase G remember that the metric tensor is a function that takes two vectors and returns their dot product this function is invariant and is the same in all coordinate systems however the metric tensor matrix components will look different in different coordinate systems the same way that vector components look different in different coordinate systems even if the vector is the same finally the metric tensor is twice covariant when the basis vectors change one way the metric tensor components change in that same way twice as seen by the two matrices here in the change of coordinates formula now you might be wondering how the metric tensor can explain black holes the expansion of the universe and gravitational waves well in general relativity mass and energy can change the rules for measuring spatial distances and times this can lead to effects like time slowing down near mass or beams of light curving around black holes instead of going in a straight line this can even lead to the expansion of the universe if the rules for measuring distance the metric tensor is changing over time this is all described in the Einstein field equations which will be explained when we reach general relativity
