welcome back to relativity 103 on Galilean relativity in this video we'll discuss the space-time separation vector also called the space-time interval vector this video makes heavy use of the concept of invariance which means that the same vector can be measured to have different components if we use different basis vectors I showed this in relativity 102 by pointing out this pencil could have components for 3 in 1 basis and components 5 0 in another basis so check out relativity 102 if you haven't seen it yet the space-time separation vector is an arrow that joins two points on the space-time diagram points on a spacetime diagram are also called events because they mark a point in space and time let's say that at this red point event at time 0 seconds and the position 0 meters albert einstein sneezes and over here three seconds later four meters to the right this green event point marks when and where richard fineman snaps his fingers in this case the space-time separation vector between Einstein and Fineman would look like this in this next example this yellow event point marks when and where the scientist mary curie claps her hands it's at the same position where einstein sneezed but five seconds later so the events are at the same position but different times and in this case the space-time separation vector would be completely vertical and in this last example this pink event point marks the time and place where Emily no there has just proven a theorem about differential symmetries this happens three meters to the right of Einstein at the same time when he sneezed so the space-time separation vector would look like this it's completely horizontal because the two events happen at the same time now to measure the space time separation vectors one option is to look at the coordinate lines on the space-time diagram if we look at these coordinate lines we see that Richard Fineman snaps his fingers at a time of three seconds and a position of four meters relative to Einsteins sneeze at the origin in common English this means that the snap happens three seconds later and four meters to the right of an stein sneeze however in the next few videos I'm not going to focus on coordinate lines very much instead I'm going to strongly encourage the use of vectors to make measurements so instead of using coordinate lines I'm going to introduce a spacetime basis which is also the same thing as a reference frame for our space-time diagrams basis vectors give us the sizes and directions of time and space in a spacetime diagram the time basis vector ET represents one unit of time in this particular case ET represents one second on our space-time diagram but in general the et basis vector can represent any unit of time that we like such as one minute one hour or one year there is also the e X basis vector which represents one unit of distance through the right so I'm going to remove the time and space axes with the times and positions marked on them and instead I'm going to measure time in space using the ET and E X basis vectors to measure the space-time separation vector between Einstein sneeze and Fineman snap we can use our space-time basis vectors we can see that the space-time separation vector s is made up of three ET vectors and 4e x vectors in common English this means that Fineman snap happens three time units after and for space units to the right of einstein's sneeze and as we can see after waiting three seconds Einstein is exactly 4 meters away from Fineman when he snaps in this example with Marie Curie's clap we can construct the space-time separation vector using only five time vectors and zero space vectors this means that Marie Curie's clap happens five time units after Einstein sneeze but they happen at the same position so zero space units are involved and we can see after five seconds Einstein is right beside Mary Curie when she claps finally the space-time separation vector between Einstein sneeze and Emily no--there's stroke of genius with her theorem is made up of three space vectors it happens three space units to the right but it happens at the same time so zero time units away so we've seen several examples of space-time separation vectors that measure time and space between two events however we've been doing the measurements from the frame of einstein who from the point of view of his own reference frame is standing still at a position of zero for all time but now let's consider the events from the frame of reference of a car that's moving to the right of Einstein at a constant speed previously we said that the space-time separation from einstein sneeze to richard fineman snap was three time units into the future and for space units to the right but looking from the reference frame of the car the snap still happens three time units into the future but it's only two and a half space units to the right Einstein and the car agree on time but they disagree on position because they are in different reference frames let's think about how position is measured from Einsteins point of view Einstein believes he is standing still and so his world line is a straight vertical line where his position doesn't change relative to the vertical axis we can place another vertical line to his left indicating a position of one unit of distance to left we can place another vertical line to his right indicating a position of one unit of distance to his right if we include one vertical line for every unit of position and also include horizontal lines denoting different moments in time we see that the coordinate lines in space-time according to Einstein form a grid of squares now let's consider doing this again but from the cars point of view the car is traveling right relative to Einstein and can be seen to have a diagonal world line but the car driver will measure all positions relative to the car itself in other words the car driver will always measure distance relative to their world line so we can place another diagonal line to the cars left indicating a position of one unit of distance to the left of the car we can place another diagonal line to its right indicating a position of one unit of distance to the cars right if we include all the other diagonal position lines as well as the horizontal time lines we can see that the coordinate lines in the space-time diagram according to the car form a grid of parallelograms for this reason the space-time basis for the car which I'm calling et tilde and E x tilde will be slightly different than Einsteins space-time basis the space vector will still point in the same direction however the time vector is now slanted so that it aligns with the cars world line this way we will be measuring position relative to the cars location on its own world line now let's once again measure the space-time separation vector for these events but this time using the diagonal time axis that lines up with the cars world line for the car we see the separation between Einstein sneeze at the origin and Fineman Snap is three units of time plus two and a half units of distance in common English this means that the snap happens three time units after and two point five space units to the right of the sneeze according to the cars perspective you'll notice that the space-time separation vector S can be measured using both Einstein space-time basis ET and e^x as well as the cars space time basis ET tilde and I X tilde and notice that even though the vector is the same the components are different when we measure it using a different basis both reference frames measure three units of time but they disagree on the spatial position this is because the space-time separation vector S is invariant it's the same unchanging vector but it has different components in different reference frames we can also measure the space-time separation between the sneeze and Marie Curie's clap in our new basis we can see that it requires five et Tilda vectors and two-and-a-half e X Tilda vectors but facing in the opposite direction this means that we need five ET Tilda basis vectors and negative 2.5 e X Tilda basis vectors in common English this means that the clap happens five time units into the future and two point five space units to the left of Einstein sneeze according to the cars reference frame again the space-time separation vector s can be measured using both Einsteins space-time basis and the cars of space-time basis and will get different components in each case the time measurements are the same but the position measurements are different finally we can measure the space-time seperation between Einstein sneeze and Emily no--there's discovery in this case we need only three E x tilde basis vectors and zero time vectors this means that no there's discovery happens three space units to the right of an stein sneeze and again we need zero time units because they happen at the same time in this case the space-time separation vector s has the same components in Einsteins frame and the cars reference frame this is because Einstein and the car are at the exact same position when Emily no there made her discovery so they are met during position from the same origin on our space-time diagram so hopefully you can now see that the same space-time separation vector can have different components when we use different reference frames I'm not going to bother showing it in this video but you could also measure the various space-time separations from the planes point of view using a different space-time basis where the time vector is aligned with the planes world line so we can see that in Galilean relativity the different inertial frames of the scientists car and plane are all represented by different space-time basis vectors where the space vector is the same in each case but the time vector is tilted at different angles so that it aligns with the object's world line in the space-time diagram now remember that in Galilean relativity there's no such thing as a special stationary reference frame we can always redraw a space-time diagram so that a different object is stationary with a vertical world line I showed how we could do this in the last video by slicing up the space-time diagram in two different instants in time almost as if we had taken a series of photographs and then sliding the time slices over to make the cars world line vertical we can draw the space-time separation vector s on our space-time diagram and build it using Einsteins basis vectors and the cars basis vectors if we shift the time slices over so that we're in the reference frame of the car all the vector additions and algebraic formulas still make sense it's just that the vectors are drawn a little differently because we changed reference frames so to summarize this video the space-time separation vector also called the space-time interval vector measures the separation in space and time between two event points on a spacetime diagram we can measure the space-time separation vector using space and time basis vectors different inertial frames will always agree on the time of all events but they will disagree on the position of events this is because each inertial frame uses a different set of space-time basis vectors and remember that space-time vectors are invariant the same space-time vector can be measured in different reference frames to give us different components even if the vector itself isn't changing the space vector is always the same in all reference frames but the time vector can be slanted at different angles so that it aligns with the reference frames world line in the next video I'll discuss Galilean transforms which tell us how to switch between the different space-time vectors for different reference frames
