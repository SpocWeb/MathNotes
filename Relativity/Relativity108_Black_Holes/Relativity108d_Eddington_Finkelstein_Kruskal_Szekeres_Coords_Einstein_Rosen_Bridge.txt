in this video we're going to cover some alternative coordinate systems for short shield black holes called the eddington finkelstein coordinates and the kruskal-sekaresh coordinates these coordinate systems make it clear that light and massive particles can indeed pass through the event horizon and they also lead to some theoretical ideas like white holes and wormholes also called einstein-rosen bridges in the previous three videos we looked at the short shield metric which is the metric for a spherically symmetric non-rotating uncharged mass we defined the short shield radius rs for a mass m as 2 mg over the speed of light squared when an object's physical radius becomes smaller than its short shield radius the object becomes a black hole with rs becoming the black hole's event horizon we found that anything that crosses into the event horizon including light can never get back out and is forced to move towards the singularity in the center now one problem with the short shield metric is that it breaks at two locations at the origin r equals zero which sends gtt to be infinite and at the event horizon r equals rs which sends grr to be infinite the infinity at the origin represents a true geometric singularity this is a location where space-time comes together in a pinch and our theory of general relativity stops working but the infinity at the event horizon is just the result of a bad choice of coordinates this is similar to how in 2d polar coordinates the origin is a point where derivatives no longer work and basis vectors aren't defined we can change from polar coordinates to cartesian coordinates to make the origin point well behaved again and similarly we can change from short shield coordinates to these other coordinate systems to make the event horizon well-behaved one thing to keep in mind is that the short shield space-time geometry is not changing in this video we're keeping the same space-time geometry but changing from the short shield coordinates to these other coordinate systems now before i derive the eddington-finkelstein coordinates i'm going to skip ahead and spend a few minutes talking about the metric in eddington finkelstein coordinates this metric looks a bit weird because it has off-diagonal components as well as a zero on the diagonal and this might confuse some people if you don't need an explanation for this you can look at the video chapters and skip ahead so we see that the metric components in short shield coordinates and eddington finkelstein coordinates are mostly the same however the eddington-finkelstein metric has some off-diagonal components this might seem weird but all this means is that the coordinate curves in eddington-finkelstein coordinates are non-orthogonal let's go back to boring 2d flat space with basis vectors e x and e y these basis vectors are orthonormal so x dot x and y dot y equal one and x dot y equals zero and remember the metric components are just the basis vector dot products so in this basis the metric tensor is the identity matrix now let's create a new basis where e x tilde equals e x plus e y and e y tilde is just e y this basis looks weird because it's not orthogonal but it still works perfectly fine for example in the first basis this vector v equals one e x plus two e y and in our new basis v equals one e x tilde plus one e y tilde we can still express vectors perfectly fine in this basis we can also calculate the metric components to get ex tilde dot ex tilde we can just sub in this formula and distribute and these dot products go to 1 zero one and one plus one is two we can also compute e x tilde dot e y tilde to be one and e y tilde dot e y tilde is also one so given these dot products we can see that the metric tensor in this basis has off-diagonal components because this basis is non-orthogonal and this is why we see off-diagonal components in the eddington-finkelstein metric the time and radial coordinates are non-orthogonal another strange thing about the eddington finkelstein coordinates is that the grr component of the metric is zero but this just means that the r-coordinate curves are light light curves that match up with the paths of light beams remember at any given point a vector inside the light cone is called time-like and has positive squared length a vector outside the light cone is called space-like and has negative squared length and a vector right on the light cone is called light-like because it follows the path of light or null because it has a squared length of zero if we look at a 2d flat space time with a time and x basis vector e t is timelike with a squared length of plus 1. e x is space-like with a squared length of negative 1 and e t and e x are orthogonal so their dot product goes to zero so our flat space time metric in this basis looks like this but we could also change basis so that e t tilde equals e t and e x tilde equals e t plus e x this means that e x tilde points diagonally along the edge of the light cone so e x tilde is a light-like vector again this might seem weird but we can use lights-like vectors in linear combinations just like any other basis vector if we calculate the dot products e t tilde dot e t tilde equals plus one e t tilde dot e x tilde equals plus one and e x tilde dot e x tilde becomes one plus zero plus negative one which equals zero so given these dot products the metric in this basis looks like this it's not orthogonal so we have off-diagonal components and e x is a lights-like vector so its squared length gxx is zero so this eddington finkelstein metric might look weird at first but just remember the off-diagonal terms mean the coordinate system is non-orthogonal and the zero here means that the r-coordinate is pointing along light-like curves on light cones now let's actually derive the eddington finkelstein coordinates which i'll call ef coordinates for short the idea behind the ef coordinates is to look at a collection of light beams falling into the black hole and use these beams of light as coordinate curves for our new coordinate system first let's remind ourselves what the light-like geodesics are for radial light beams whose tangent vectors d by d lambda have zero squared length if we set the path parameter lambda to be the r-coordinate we end up with this differential equation whose solution looks like this with plus four light beams going away from the black hole and minus for light beams going into the black hole so far from the short shield radius this log part goes to zero and these just become diagonal lines but close to the short shield radius the log part blows up to infinity and it appears as though in-going light beams never cross the horizon however it should be noted that light beams and massive particles can indeed cross the event horizon it's just that the schwarzschild time coordinate ct measures proper time for an observer very far away from the mass and from this distant observer's perspective nothing ever appears to cross the event horizon due to gravitational time dilation but when looking at an in-falling observer in their own reference frame they can cross through the event horizon just fine also note that this solution involves the log of an absolute value so we get additional solutions for light beams inside the event horizon where r is less than rs the light beams in this region appear disconnected from the outside light beams we can fix this by changing our time coordinate ct to a new time coordinate ct tilde by shifting ct by this logarithm term this new time coordinate is called the advanced time coordinate if we look at our equation for the paths of in-going light beams and replace ct using this formula we find that the log terms cancel so using this new time coordinate in-going light beams have a slope of negative 1 and our diagonal everywhere even across the event horizon so we can see that light beams do indeed pass through the event horizon without any problems so why did this trick work well if you look at the in-going light geodesics outside the event horizon and inside the event horizon they appear to be disconnected but you can loosely think of them as being connected up at infinity this new time coordinate basically shifts time to pull these curves down and the amount of shifting depends on r the closer we are to the event horizon the more shifting happens and at r equals rs we basically do an infinite amount of shifting to bring down the curve from infinity so the advanced time coordinate c t tilde gives us a nice coordinate system where in going light like geodesics pass through the event horizon and have a constant slope of negative 1 but we still haven't reached the eddington finkelstein coordinates yet for ef coordinates we want light beams to travel along constant coordinate lines instead of being diagonal so instead of shifting the time coordinate by the log term let's define a new coordinate v that shifts time by the entire r plus log term going back to our light beam equation and subbing in we get an equation for in-going light beams that is just the v-coordinate being constant so in these coordinates the curves of constant v exactly match in going light beams so in eddington finkelstein coordinates v equals this and the r coordinate is the same as the short shield r coordinate i've labeled the eddington finkelstein r coordinate as are in since this is a coordinate system based on in-going light beams in eddington-finkelstein coordinates a constant v-coordinate labels a specific in-going light beam and r rn lets us travel left and right along these light beams lining up with the short shield r-coordinate on the horizontal axis so the eddington-finkelstein coordinate axes look like this let's calculate the metric components for the eddington finkelstein coordinates remember the metric components are just the basis vector dot products we can get the ef basis vectors for v and rn from the short shield basis vectors for c t and r using multi-variable chain rule to expand the vectors most of these derivatives are easy to calculate but this c t over rn derivative is more difficult to help compute this let's introduce an intermediate variable r star which equals r plus this log term we can rewrite the v and rn formulas like this and rearrange to solve for c t and r we can show that d r star by d r n equals one over one minus r s over r taking the derivatives of these formulas the v basis vector just equals the ct basis vector for the rn basis vector we can expand the derivative of ct by rn using the single variable chain rule with r star since r star only depends on the single variable r this equals negative 1 and we solved for this derivative on a previous slide so we have formulas for the v and rn basis vectors looking at the basis vectors visually we see that the ct and v basis vectors point in the same direction as we saw before and the rn basis vector points in the same direction as the r basis vector but with an additional negative ct component so it points downward somewhat and this is exactly what we need for rn to point along the direction of light beams so geometrically these basis vectors are exactly what we would expect calculating rn.rn and subbing in the short shield components gtt and grr as expected we get zero so the r in direction points along light beams we also get v dot rn to be negative 1 and v dot v to be the same as ct.ct since v and ct have the same basis vector if we were to take the squared length of a tangent vector d by d lambda traveling in the radial direction its length would be given by this formula which contains a cross term with v and rn because these directions are not orthogonal and there is no rn squared term because rn is light-like with a squared length of zero we can also plot the outgoing light beams by considering the plus sign of the equation instead here instead of the log parts canceling out these add together and the equations for outgoing light beams look similar to what we saw in the schwarzschild coordinates in relativity 108 b that these light beams are not defined on the event horizon plotting on the spacetime diagram we can see that the light cones rotate as they cross the event horizon and we can see that any light beams or massive particles that cross into the event horizon can never get back out because of the orientation of these light cones now what i just showed you is called the in-going ef coordinates v and r-n because the coordinate lines match up with in-going light beams but we could do a similar trick for outgoing light beams to get the outgoing ef coordinates u and r out and we do this by shifting the c t coordinates using subtraction instead of addition you can check that using this change of coordinates outgoing light beams have a constant u coordinate and in-going light beams look like this and note that they are not defined at the event horizon we get these basis vectors where the u basis vector is the same as the ct basis vector and the r out basis vector is pointing rightward like the r basis vector but angled upward because of this plus c t part for the metric components r out has a squared length of zero because it aligns with outgoing light beams u dot r out is plus 1 and u has the same length as the c t basis vector so the formula for the squared length of a tangent vector looks like this and the two metrics for in going and outgoing ef coordinates look like this for outgoing ef coordinates light beams on our space-time diagram look like this with light cones pointing out of the event horizon here we mysteriously see light beams leaving the event horizon and all matter in the light cones being forced out of the event horizon as well unable to return inside this describes the opposite of a black hole and so we call it a white hole so why did the in-going ef coordinates give us a black hole and the outgoing ef coordinates gave us a white hole it turns out that the black hole and white hole exist together in space-time but the ef coordinates only let us see one of them at a time to understand this we'll derive a new set of coordinates called the kruskal-sekaresh coordinates so the eddington finkelstein coordinates are nice because they demystify the event horizon and show that light and massive particles can travel through it just fine but these coordinates still have problems for the in-going ef coordinates outgoing light beams stop working on the event horizon and for outgoing ef coordinates incoming light beams stop working on the event horizon we also saw the mysterious appearance of a white hole for outgoing ef coordinates it would be nice if we could invent a coordinate system where light beams work in both directions at the same time this motivates the kruskal's sekiresh coordinates which i'll call ks coordinates for short in these coordinates all light beams appear as diagonal lines the black hole event horizon is also a diagonal line and the singularity in the black hole center is drawn as a hyperbola this makes it much more obvious that lights can never get out of the event horizon once it enters because light will always travel parallel to the event horizon and eventually hit the hyperbola singularity no matter what so if we want coordinates where light beams work fine in both directions a first guess is to take the v coordinate from in going ef coordinates and the u-coordinate from outgoing ef coordinates and use them together to make a new coordinate system if we think of time as pointing up and r as pointing right on a space-time diagram these formulas mix the time and space directions in just the right way so that u and v point along the two light-like directions of the light cone we can also mix u and v in the right amounts to get back ct and r and recall this r plus log term is written as r star for short you can pause the video if you want to look at the calculations but we can use the standard procedure for expanding the new basis vectors by using multivariable chain rule looking at these basis vectors we see that v points up and to the right and u points up and to the left but there's a problem here as r approaches the event horizon the r components get smaller and smaller until the light cone closes up and the unv directions overlap on the event horizon so this new coordinate system still breaks on the event horizon we can't have a 2d coordinate system where both coordinates point in the same direction looking at the metric as expected v dot v is zero because v is a light like direction and u dot u is zero because u is also light like u dot v ends up being one half times one minus rs over r the squared length of an arbitrary radial tangent vector becomes this in most locations this metric is fine but again at r equals rs this term becomes zero so the entire upper left square of the metric becomes zero this tells us that the coordinate lines close over each other which means that our coordinate system is broken this single basis vector is light-like with zero squared length and light-like vectors are also orthogonal to themselves so the off-diagonal terms are also zero the reason our change of coordinates has a problem at the event horizon is this log term and we need to find a way to get rid of it the resolution to this is a clever coordinate substitution first we'll divide all terms by rs then exponentiate both sides we rewrite the exponential sums as products of exponentials and e and log are inverse functions so they cancel each other out i've also introduced a couple negative signs here to prepare us for the clever coordinate substitution which is big v equals e to the v over two rs and big u equals negative e to the negative u over two rs subbing these in we get minus the product of big v and big u so this change of coordinates formula no longer has a logarithm term so we have these coordinate transformations and we can easily get the inverse transformations just by taking logs to undo the exponentials now since these are single variable coordinate transformations the directions of the basis vectors aren't actually changing they're just getting rescaled so they both still point along light beams and have a square length of zero the question is do we still have the problem where the two basis vectors overlap on the event horizon to find out we need to calculate big u dot big v and make sure it doesn't go to zero on the event horizon we can take these derivatives sub n the dot product for small u dot small v and sub in the big v times big u formula we saw on a previous slide and after a bunch of algebra we get that big v dot big u equals this and this quantity doesn't go to zero on the event horizon so these coordinates work everywhere except at the singularity where r equals zero so the metric with these big v and big u coordinates looks like this where both the big u and big v directions are light like and non-orthogonal and the squared length of a tangent vector looks like this now both big v and big u are light-like directions and it's a bit hard to interpret what our space-time diagram looks like using these coordinates it would be nice to convert these back to coordinates that resemble time and space which i'll call big t and big x so before to get the lights like u and v coordinates we added or subtracted time and space coordinates the reverse formulas look like this so to turn the lights like big v and big u coordinates back into time and space coordinates we can use a similar relationship writing them as additions or subtractions of a time coordinate big t and a space coordinate big x we can once again compute the metric components by expanding the basis vectors using multivariable chain rule we find the big t big t metric component is positive 2 times g big u big v and the big x big x metric component is negative 2 times g big u big v you can also check that big t and big x are orthogonal directions so the metric in big t big x coordinates looks like this this makes sense since big t has positive squared length as expected for a time-like coordinate and big x has negative squared length as expected for a space-like coordinate and they are orthogonal so off-diagonal terms go to zero also the squared length of a radial tangent vector in these coordinates looks like this if we wanted to look at the paths of light beams we just send this to zero and to solve this we find we just need to sub in a diagonal line like t equals plus or minus x plus a constant okay so everything we just did was probably a bit confusing so let's review we started with the short shield time and space coordinates then we switched to the light like u and v coordinates inspired by the eddington finkelstein coordinates then we used this rescaling trick to get big v and big u which are also lights like but are not broken at the event horizon then we converted to big t and big x which are more similar to ordinary time and space coordinates these big t and big x coordinates are called the kruskal-sekaresh coordinates now it would be useful to have a formula that converts straight from the short shield coordinates c t and r to the kruskal-sekaresh coordinates big t and big x so we can start with the formulas for big t then sub in the conversions from big v and big u to the small v and small u then we can sub in the formulas from u and v to the short shield coordinates using exponent rules we can rewrite exponentials of sums to products of exponentials note that this rs in front of the log is cancelled by this outer rs the exponential of a product can be rewritten as repeated exponentiation so we can put a power of one-half up here then since e and log are inverse functions they cancel and we just get r over r s minus one to the power of one-half which is the same thing as a square root we can then factor the r terms out and get one-half times the difference of exponentials involving ct and you might recognize this as the formula for hyperbolic sine of ct so this is our formula for converting ct and r into big t and we can get a similar formula for big x except it involves a sum of exponentials and so this becomes hyperbolic cosine instead so looking at these formulas they sort of resemble the formulas for rindler coordinates that we studied back in relativity 105 for accelerated observers and special relativity basically the space coordinate denotes a series of hyperbolas and the time coordinate is like a hyperbolic angle that lets us select a location along the hyperbolas the event horizon is located at r equals rs which is a hyperbola that's pushed so close to the origin that it becomes a pair of diagonal lines and again light beams in ks coordinates are just diagonal lines now the light beams in these coordinates look nice but this space-time diagram does look a bit fishy why does our space-time diagram and in-going light beams stop at the event horizon and why do outgoing light beams appear to emerge from this other event horizon down here it turns out that the ks coordinate system is actually composed of four space-time regions and right now we're only looking at the first region we need to go back to our coordinate transformation and think more carefully about this e to the log term recall that when we take the square root of a number we actually get two answers so for example the square root of nine can be either plus three or minus three so any time we take a square root if we want to list all possible solutions we need to put a plus or minus sign in front and when we took the square root of this term we failed to consider the negative solution so when we're getting a formula for the big t coordinate these e to the log terms that we take the square root of actually give us two independent plus or minus signs which means that the final result involves four possible options plus sign h plus cos h minus sign h and minus cos h so we have two independent signs that can be chosen to be either positive or negative and together these create four possible regions of space-time with different combinations of plus and minus sign h and cos h also notice that for regions two and four we're assuming that the value inside the absolute value under the square root sign ends up being negative or in other words we're assuming that r is smaller than the event horizon rs so we reverse the order of the terms here putting all this together we get four separate coordinate system patches over all of space-time for each triangular wedge of the coordinate system ct travels counterclockwise from negative infinity to positive infinity in regions 1 and 3 the r-coordinate points outward and for regions 2 and 4 the r-coordinate points inward for regions 2 and 4 if we plug in r equals 0 which is the location of the singularity we get equations for hyperbolas on the upper and lower halves of our space-time diagram so in ks coordinates the singularities are drawn as hyperbolas the upper singularity represents a black hole and the lower singularity represents a white hole as you can see when looking at outgoing light beams if a light beam is released inside region 2 which is inside the event horizon of the black hole the diagonal light beam can never get out into region 1 again and the light beam is doomed to eventually hit the black hole's hyperbola singularity for the white hole below it's the opposite any beam of light released inside region 4 can exit the white hole event horizon which is the diagonal line between regions 1 and 4. but in-going light beams from region 1 can never get back inside region 4. so the in-going eddington finkelstein coordinates that we saw before showed us the outer region and the black hole singularity whereas the outgoing addington finkelstein coordinates showed us the outer region and the whitehole singularity but the kruskal-sekaresh coordinates show both singularities at once region 3 over here can be thought of as another outer space time existing in parallel with region 1 sharing the same black hole and white hole but with the light beams reversed in direction these two parallel space times in regions one and three are connected by a geometry called a wormhole also called an einstein rosen bridge in relativity 108 b we talked about how black holes stretch space itself so that one unit of the r coordinate is worth more physical distance as we get closer to the event horizon we showed that we could embed a two-dimensional spatial slice given by the r and phi coordinates in three-dimensional space in such a way that the distances we see with our eyes match up with the physical distances near the black hole here the w coordinate has no physical meaning it's just an extra coordinate that we use to display distances correctly in our 3d embedding space the resulting surface is called flam's paraboloid you can derive flam's paraboloid by taking the short shield metric for constant time and theta equals pi over 2 and setting it equal to the 3d embedding space metric then solving the resulting differential equation now in our kruskal-sekaresh space-time diagram if we look at the constant time ct equals zero we get one flams paraboloid when approaching the event horizon at the origin from region 1 and another flamp's paraboloid when approaching the origin from region 3. putting them together we get the wormhole or einstein-rosen bridge connecting regions 1 and 3. however as seen on our space time diagram light can never travel fast enough to get from region 1 to region 3 or vice versa so even if the two regions are connected geometrically by a wormhole no mass or light can actually travel between the regions as we move forward or backward in time away from the origin the wormhole pinches off and the two space times in regions 1 and 3 become separate again so the wormhole geometry only appears for a short amount of time before it collapses and this period of time is too short for anything to traverse it that said short shield wormholes are not the only type of wormhole and other wormhole types may end up being traversable now i should mention that the parallel region 3 and the whitehole region 4 are mathematical possibilities that exist for eternal black holes which are theoretical black holes that have existed for all time but we have never observed white holes or wormholes in real life for black holes that result from the collapse of a star and whose life has a definite starting point regions three and four of this space time don't exist so at this point in time we have no reason to believe white holes or wormholes exist in our universe even if they are valid mathematical possibilities that come from the short shield space-time geometry so to summarize this video we looked at alternative coordinates for short shield geometry that don't break on the event horizon by changing to the advanced time coordinate we were able to pull the in-going light beams from infinity so that they cross the event horizon just fine using these light beams as coordinate lines gives us the in-going eddington finkelstein coordinates for a black hole if we shift time using subtraction instead we get the outgoing eddington-finkelstein coordinates for a white hole using both in-going and outgoing light beams as coordinate lines and using this clever coordinate substitution gives us the kruskal-sekaresh coordinates which show the maximally extended short shield space time with a black hole white hole and two parallel exterior space times one more coordinate system i didn't talk about is the penrose diagram you can check the links in the description to learn more about it
