in this video we're going to derive the geodesics for the short shield geometry these are the paths that massive objects and light beams will take in the curved space time near a spherically symmetric electrically neutral non-rotating body so basically this is how the gravity of planets stars and black holes affect light and mass we're going to see some gravitational effects that don't happen in newtonian gravity and are unique to general relativity like gravitational lensing of light around massive bodies and the perihelion shift in the orbit of massive bodies like mercury's orbit around the sun these were both early tests of the accuracy of general relativity after it was proposed by einstein so in this video i'm going to give a quick review of geodesics then review gravitational orbits in newtonian space-time then derive schwarzschild geodesics then compare the orbits of bodies in newtonian gravity and general relativity which includes discussion of how gravity affects light and also the perihelion shift of orbits you can feel free to look at the video timestamps and skip ahead if you want so now i'll give a quick review of geodesics based on what i said in relativity 105 f a massive particle's world line through space time can be parametrized by its proper time tau the tangent vectors with respect to tau are the particles for velocity vectors u the four velocity is a time-like vector meaning its squared length is always positive and it always lives inside the light cone because massive objects can't travel faster than light the rate of change of the four velocity vector with respect to proper time tau is the particles for acceleration vector a the four acceleration is a space like vector meaning its squared length is always negative and it always lives outside the light cone the square root of the negative squared length of the four acceleration vector is the particle's proper acceleration alpha this is the number that the particle would measure on an accelerometer that it's carrying along with it a particle with no forces acting on it has a zero for acceleration vector and it follows a path through space-time called a geodesic which is sort of like the straightest possible path through space-time in general relativity gravity is just the natural motion of objects traveling along geodesics through a curved space-time an object orbiting a planet or freely falling down towards the planet will both measure no proper acceleration on their accelerometers so these are traveling along geodesics in space-time an object that's in deep space firing its rockets or an object that's sitting on a planet's surface would both have a non-zero reading on an accelerometer these objects are not traveling along a geodesic the object in deep space with rockets firing has a four acceleration vector that's pulling it away from a geodesic path and the object sitting on the planet's surface has the molecular forces of the planet's particles forcing it upward away from a geodesic that would normally pull it towards the planet's center so setting an object's for acceleration vector equal to zero gives us the geodesic equation which can be written in several different ways solving the geodesic equation gives us the paths of freely falling particles through space-time that are only affected by gravity and no other forces now light beams are massless and always have a proper time of zero by definition so we can't define a four velocity vector or for acceleration vector for light instead we parameterize light-like paths by a generic path parameter lambda which gives tangent vectors d by d lambda along the light world lines these tangent vectors always live directly on the light cone so they are called light-like vectors or null vectors because their squared length is zero a light-like geodesic is a geodesic where every tangent vector along the path is light-like so the rate of change of these tangent vectors is zero this gives us another geodesic equation that's parameterized with a generic path parameter lambda instead of proper time tau it turns out that using a generic path parameter lambda instead of proper time tau gives us a geodesic equation that works for both massive particles and massless light beams so massive particles follow geodesics with time-like tangent vectors and massless light beams follow geodesics with light-like or null tangent vectors but both light and massive objects obey the same geodesic equation our goal for this video will be to take the geodesic equation and use it to solve for the paths of massive particles and massless light beams through short shield space time where the curved space time is caused by a spherically symmetric non-rotating uncharged mass before we look at geodesics in general relativity let's do a quick review of gravitational orbits in newtonian gravity let's say we're looking at the coordinates of a planet orbiting a star using the 2d polar coordinates r and phi the planet's position vector is capital r and its velocity vector is d capital r by dt where t is the universal newtonian time coordinate the basis vectors for this coordinate system e r and e phi are just the partial derivatives of the position vector with respect to r and phi using multi-variable chain rule we can expand the velocity vector in terms of the radial coordinate r and the angular coordinate phi and here i'm going to denote time derivatives using an overhead dot above the variable and the derivatives of the position vector with respect to the coordinate variables give us the basis vectors e r and e phi the squared magnitude of the velocity vector is just the dot product of the velocity vector with itself using the metric for polar coordinates where e r has length 1 e r and e phi are orthogonal and e phi has length r so this dot product gives r squared we get this formula for the squared velocity magnitude we know that this planet's angular momentum vector l is just the cross product between its position vector capital r and its linear momentum p which is mass times its velocity vector if we sub in our formulas for the position and velocity vectors and distribute over the cross product we know that the cross product of a vector with itself is zero so er cross er is zero and the cross product of e r and e phi is a vector perpendicular to them both whose length is equal to the area of the parallelogram formed by er and e phi this area is 1 times r since e phi has length r and the perpendicular vector is e z so the radial velocity doesn't contribute to angular momentum only the angular velocity does and rearranging we see that the magnitude of the angular momentum l over m r squared equals phi dot we know the total energy of the orbiting planet is just its kinetic energy one-half mv squared plus the potential energy which is mass times the gravitational potential function v of r in previous videos i wrote the potential as phi but in this video i'm going to write it as v we can sub in our formula for velocity squared then distribute one half m then sub in our formula for phi dot then do some cancelling we can also use the standard newtonian potential for a mass capital m which is negative g capital m over r now we see that in polar coordinates kinetic energy actually depends on the r coordinate position we can group this r dependent kinetic energy term together with the r-dependent potential term and called the combined terms the effective potential v sub f this is our main equation of motion for gravitational orbits in newtonian gravity where e is the constant total energy and l is the constant angular momentum technically speaking these two terms give kinetic energy and this term gives potential energy but in this video i'm going to treat this term as the effective kinetic energy because it depends on r dot and i'll call these two terms the effective potential energy because they depend on r for now we're going to put this equation aside and derive the geodesics in our new theory of gravity general relativity we're going to find that the equation describing the orbit in general relativity is nearly the exact same as in newtonian gravity but with some slight changes so our geodesic equation is actually four separate equations one for each space-time coordinate this sigma index can refer to any of the four space-time variables ctr theta and phi to make our lives easier we're going to assume our geodesics have a constant theta value of theta equals pi over 2 meaning the orbit is in the plane of the equator in our coordinate system and all theta derivatives go to zero we're allowed to make this assumption because our central mass is spherically symmetric and we can always rotate our coordinate system so the orbit is in the plane of theta equals pi over 2. now in relativity 108 a i wrote out the short shield metric in terms of two functions a of r and b of r and then we determined that a equals one minus r s over r where r s is the short shield radius and b is one over a which can be written as r over r minus r s if we calculate the derivatives of a and b we can sub them in to get formulas for the connection coefficients ttr rtt rr as well as r theta theta and r phi phi so we now know all nine non-zero connection coefficients for the schwarzschild metric written as explicit functions of r and theta now you'll notice that our short shield metric only depends on r and theta but doesn't depend on time or phi this is a hint that there are conserved quantities associated with the time and phi variables a more technical discussion of this involves killing vectors but i won't discuss that in this video so our time and phi geodesic equations will give us conserved quantities the our geodesic equation will give us an equation for tracking the orbiting body's radial distance and because we're using a constant theta equals pi over two coordinate the theta geodesic equation just becomes zero equals zero let's start with the time geodesic equation to write out this summation over mu and nu we need to find all the connection coefficients with t on top there are only two connection coefficients with t on top which are the ttr and trt connection coefficients and they both equal each other so i'm just going to write this sum as 2 times gamma ttr matching t with a time derivative and r with an r derivative and we can replace the ttr coefficients with this and then cancel the two and one half we can show that this equation tells us that this quantity the derivative of ct times 1 minus rs over r is a constant of motion that doesn't change along geodesics to see this let's take the derivative of this quantity we use product rule and get the derivative of the derivative in the first term and the derivative of one minus r s over r in the second term the derivative of one is zero and we can use power rule on the derivative of r to the negative one to get r to the negative 2 with a minus 1 in front times a chain rule term these negative signs cancel and if we write this 1 as r over r we get an equation that's equivalent to the right hand side of our time geodesic equation which equals zero so if this equals zero we just multiply by the reciprocal of this term cancel r and we get our original geodesic equation so since the derivative of this term equals zero it is a constant quantity along geodesics this constant is sort of like the energy per unit mass which we will denote by curly e if we look at this constant of motion very far away from the mass as r approaches infinity and rewrite dt by d tau as gamma and multiply by mass we see that this value is the time component of the four momentum vector from special relativity so this is one reason why we refer to this constant of motion as energy for the r geodesic equation we get four connection coefficients with r on top and since theta is constant the theta derivative goes to zero if we plug everything in this sine theta goes to one but we still get a pretty complicated equation we're actually not going to worry about this equation in this video for the theta geodesic equation there are three connection coefficients with theta on top and if we assume theta is a constant of pi over 2 with these derivatives being zero this equation just becomes 0 equals 0. this is a good thing because it tells us that a constant value of theta equals pi over 2 does not violate our geodesic equations so it's acceptable to assume all geodesic motion happens in a flat plane finally for the phi geodesic equation there are four connection coefficients with phi on top but since theta derivatives are zero this last term goes to zero so we just have this for our phi geodesic equation this is associated with another constant of motion which is r squared times the derivative of phi if we take the derivative of this apply product rule to both r squared and the derivative of phi then here we use power rule to get two r times a chain rule term this result is equivalent to our original phi geodesic equation we just take this to equal 0 and divide by r squared the formula r squared times the derivative of phi is actually the same formula as the newtonian angular momentum l per unit mass which we will denote as curly l this is a conserved quantity associated with translations in the phi coordinate which are basically rotations so it makes sense that it's the angular momentum so we've found two constants of motion for our geodesics but there's one more thing we need which is an equation for the squared length of our tangent vector which comes from the metric expanding the tangent vectors using multi-variable chain rule we get our standard metric formula for the squared length of a vector which expands to four terms using our schwarzschild metric the theta derivative is zero and plugging things in this sine theta goes to 1. so we have a formula for the squared length of our geodesics tangent vectors notice that the derivative of ct also lives in our energy constant of motion with some algebra we can solve for the derivative of c t the derivative of phi can also be solved for using our angular momentum constant of motion we can now plug these in to get this as a final step we can set the squared length of our tangent vector equal to a number epsilon this number is zero for light like geodesics and positive for time-like geodesics that massive bodies follow we can then rewrite 1 minus rs over r as r minus rs all over r and do some canceling and bring epsilon to the right hand side then we can multiply all terms by r minus rs over r leading to cancellations here and here and we can again rewrite this as 1 minus rs over r if we bring curly e to the other side of the equation and distribute we find we get an equation that kind of looks like a total energy equation involving a derivative of r for the kinetic energy and an effective potential term that only depends on r and remember the epsilon equals zero case is for light and the epsilon greater than zero case is for massive bodies let's start with the massive body case we can sub in the full formula for the short shield radius and use proper time tau as the path parameter this means that epsilon is just the 4 velocity dotted with itself which is the speed of light squared putting this all in we can cancel c squared and then multiply all terms by one half with a little more algebra we can make this look more like the equation describing newtonian orbits we can replace curly l with angular momentum over mass and replace curly e with energy over mass then multiply both sides of the equation by mass then move this constant one half m c squared to the other side of the equation if we now compare the equations for newtonian orbits and orbits in general relativity we see that both equations have a constant term on the left-hand side that's related to energy the general relativity energy term looks more complicated but the important thing is that it's constant we also have an r derivative term that's like kinetic energy and several terms that depend on r which are like the effective potential the newtonian and general relativity effective potentials are the exact same except for a term involving 1 over r cubed this last term goes to 0 very quickly when r is large but it can have a very large effect for small r so the main differences between massive body orbits in newtonian gravity and general relativity should only occur at small values of r due to this new one over r cubed potential term one way to understand these equations is to graph the effective potentials in each case to simplify graphing the newtonian potential i'm going to assume all the masses and physical constants are equal to 1. we can then plot this function for different values of angular momentum l to get a sense of their basic shapes now let's focus on the l equals 0.5 case we know that the total energy is constant and the kinetic term and potential term can each get bigger or smaller as long as their sum is a constant value if we say this is the amount of total energy e in the system we know that the orbiting body is going to be restricted to this region of the graph the amount of potential energy can go up and down but it can never exceed the amount of total energy so a body with this amount of energy can't leave this potential well the points where the constant energy line intersects the potential curve are the points where the total energy and potential energy are equal meaning the kinetic energy must be zero so the orbiting body will go back and forth in this potential well this represents an elliptical orbit where the radius reaches a maximum point then turns around then reaches a minimum point then turns around again with the radial velocity being zero at the turning points if instead the total energy line is exactly at the bottom of the potential well then the potential energy and total energy are equal for all time this means that the r dot term is zero for all time so the radius is constant for all time this corresponds to a circular orbit with a constant radius if the energy is very high above the potential well then the mass has too much energy to be caught in an orbit so it just approaches the central mass then leaves again and goes off to infinity getting deflected by some angle we can solve for the exact radius of circular orbits by setting the radius to be constant so that the derivative of r or r dot is zero this means that the constant total energy equals the effective potential energy so v effective is constant meaning its derivative is zero if we take this derivative using power rule cancel minus signs multiply by r cubed and cancel we can solve for the radius of circular orbits in newtonian gravity l squared over m squared g big m now let's use this same graphing approach for the potential in general relativity i'm going to replace the energy term on the left hand side of the equation with curly e tilde to save space again setting the masses and physical constants 2 1 these are the potential curves for various values of curly l we can see that there is a circular orbit right at this peak here if we have the exact right amount of energy but if we nudge this mass even a little it will either fall towards the central mass or go off towards infinity so this is an unstable circular orbit because even a slight change to the energy will stop the body from orbiting altogether now it's difficult to see on this graph but there's actually a second circular orbit at this point here this part of the potential graph actually forms a very shallow well where circular and elliptical orbits can exist just like in newtonian gravity so unlike newtonian gravity general relativity predicts two possible circular orbits for a given angular momentum we can solve for the radii of these two circular orbits assuming the orbit radius is constant meaning the effective potential energy is constant and has zero derivative we use power rule on the rest of the terms cancelling these negatives and these twos multiplying by r to the fourth and canceling we get an equation that's quadratic and r and can be solved using the quadratic formula subbing in we get this solution for the two circular orbits given by the plus and minus signs here these give the locations of the two possible circular orbits in general relativity the circular orbit closer to the mass is unstable and changing the energy even a little will cause the body to stop orbiting the second circular orbit that's farther away is a stable circular orbit changing the body's energy by a little bit will simply change the circular orbit into an elliptical orbit also we can compare the circular orbits from general relativity to the circular orbit in newtonian gravity if we take the speed of light to approach infinity this term goes to zero after canceling and replacing script l with l over mass we recover the expected circular orbit from newtonian gravity so this means that when we're dealing with small masses and slow speeds newtonian gravity is a very good approximation for general relativity now as we tweak the script l constant of motion there is a threshold where the unstable and stable circular orbits become the same mathematically this is when the discriminant of the quadratic formula becomes zero we can solve this point to be when curly l squared equals 12 g m over c all squared plugging this back in for curly l squared and knowing the discriminant is zero we get a critical radius of six masses times a physical constant which is also equal to 3 short shield radii this is the smallest possible stable orbit in general relativity this distance is also called the innermost stable circular orbit or isco now if we want to look at the orbits for light we can just take our original equation and set epsilon equal to zero which reduces the effective potential to just two terms we can again find circular orbits by forcing the r-coordinate to be constant meaning the effective potential is constant meaning its derivative is zero we take this derivative using power rule cancel negative signs multiply the equation by r to the 4 and cancel and we can solve for a circular orbit at 3 over 2 times the short shield radius which is also 3 times the central mass capital m times a physical constant this means that for a short shield black hole if we turn on a flashlight sideways at exactly 1.5 times the radius of the event horizon the light beam would orbit the black hole in a circular orbit because of this the sphere with a radius of 1.5 short shield radii is called the photon sphere if we graph the potential for the orbits of light we can see the circular orbits appearing at 1.5 times the short shield radius for all values of curly l but even outside this radius the central mass will still impact the path of light beams deflecting them somewhat from a straight path the first evidence that light beams from distant stars were bending due to the sun's gravity was collected during a total solar eclipse on may 29 1919 during the eddington experiment which was an early experimental confirmation of the predictions of general relativity the last thing i'll cover in this video is another early experimental confirmation of general relativity which is the perihelion shift of planetary orbits specifically in the case of mercury newtonian gravity tells us that planets orbit the sun in elliptical orbits where the perihelion is the smallest distance between the planet and the sun in general relativity the extra one over r cubed potential term causes the perihelion to advance in the direction of orbit resulting in a flower-like orbit shape however this effect is extremely tiny and is usually only noticeable for small values of r over long periods of time perihelion advance in general relativity technically happens to all the planets in the solar system but the effect is most obvious for mercury since it's the closest to the sun to derive perihelion shift the goal is to get the formula for the planet's orbit radius r in terms of the orbit angle phi the mathematical derivation of this is a bit crazy so i'm going to speed through it and you can pause if you want to go through it more carefully we start with our energy equation then use the case for massive bodies we can use single variable chain rule to rewrite d r by d tau as d r by d phi times d phi by d tau which we can rewrite using our curly l constant of motion then we multiply by r squared over curly l squared and change variables so that r equals 1 over u this has the advantage of the derivative of r over r equaling the negative derivative of u over u then we multiply by u squared we then differentiate both sides by phi and cancel d u by d phi on all terms multiply by this and cancel the twos we can again change variables to w to absorb this constant and we end up with this differential equation where alpha is this constant on its own the left-hand side of this differential equation equaling 0 is just the simple harmonic oscillator with a sinusoidal solution if we include the constant 1 on the right-hand side we get the equation for an ellipse where this e value is the ellipse's eccentricity the last term is the correction from general relativity and corresponds to the one over r cubed term from the effective potential we can write w as a power series in alpha subbing in if we set the terms without alpha coefficients equal to each other we get the original newtonian differential equation for w0 which we know the solution to if we set the terms with the first power of alpha equal to each other we get this differential equation for w1 if we assume alpha is small we can ignore the alpha squared and higher order terms so the orbit solution is basically the newtonian solution w0 plus a small perturbation involving w1 after squaring this and using trig identities to replace cosine squared with a double angle this differential equation can be solved by assuming a solution of this form with this constant and sinusoids multiplied by linear terms with four unknowns if we find the second derivative and add it to the original function we get this matching this form with the original differential equation we get that small a is the eccentricity small b is zero big b is negative one over six e squared and big a's value doesn't matter so we'll just take it to be zero putting w0 and w1 back into the power series we notice this sine term multiplied by a linear factor and this is the term that causes the advance of the perihelion so we have an equation for w using the small angle approximation for sine and cosine we can rewrite this using an angle difference trig identity and see that this cosine term does not have a period of two pi instead it has a period of two pi over one minus alpha if we multiply this by one plus alpha over one plus alpha and assume alpha squared goes to zero since alpha is small we find that for a planet to complete one orbit and get back to the starting radius it must cover an angle of 2 pi plus an advance of 2 pi times alpha which is the advance of the perihelion to calculate alpha for mercury we can easily get the sun's short shield radius rs from the sun's mass to get mercury's angular momentum per unit mass curly l we can make the simplifying assumption that the angular momentum is the exact same as when mercury has a perfectly elliptical orbit comparing the ellipse equation to the w0 formula we derived and setting the numerators equal to each other we can calculate mercury's curly l in terms of its orbit eccentricity e and the semi-major axis a which gives this putting all this together we get a perihelion advance of 2 pi times 8 times 10 to the negative 8 radians per orbit knowing mercury's orbital period around the sun to be 88 earth days we can calculate mercury's perihelion advance in one earth century which is 0.000208 radians or 43 arcseconds in reality mercury's perihelion shift per century is larger due to the gravity of the other planets in the solar system but 43 arc seconds is the amount of observed perihelion shift that cannot be explained by the gravity of the other planets it's a small correction factor that general relativity was able to predict so to summarize this video we used the connection coefficients for the schwarzschild metric to calculate the geodesic equations for the short shield metric for a constant value of theta equals pi over two the time and phi geodesic equations both gave us a constant of motion and these let us turn the equation for the squared magnitude of a tangent vector into an equation that relates total energy the derivative of the r coordinate and an effective potential that depends on r the main difference between newtonian gravity and general relativity is this one over r cubed potential term this term is negligible at large values of r but causes non-newtonian effects for small values of r such as the existence of an extra circular orbit a minimum innermost circular orbit and the perihelion shift of elliptical orbits general relativity also predicts that light rays will bend in the presence of mass and can even orbit the mass along the photon sphere at a radius of 1.5 short shield radii in the 108 d video we'll cover alternative coordinate systems for short shield geometry that will help make interpreting the geometry easier
