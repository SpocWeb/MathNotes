in this video we're going to discuss how gravity can shift the frequency of light in general relativity due to the presence of a spherical mass described by the short shield metric this frequency shift ends up being similar to the doppler effect that we saw in special relativity in an earlier video the method i'm going to use to derive gravitational frequency shift in this video uses the wave covector you might find this method to be a lengthy and roundabout way of doing things but my goal here is to show that the doppler shift from galilean relativity doppler shift from special relativity and frequency shift due to gravity can all be handled using the same approach for both inertial observers and non-inertial observers we don't need to learn six different approaches and treat all of these as separate special cases just as we measure momentum and energy in different frames by measuring different components of the four momentum vector in different reference frames all we need to do to understand frequency shift is to draw the wave co-vector and then look at how different frames measure different components of the wave covector and this will work every time in all cases at the end of this video i'll do a comparison between gravitational frequency shift in general relativity and doppler shift in special relativity for non-inertial observers and i'll talk about how these are related to the equivalence principle in the relativity 106 a video we saw that understanding the doppler effect becomes very easy when we use a geometric object called a covector as a reminder a vector is like an arrow and it represents something with a direction and a length meanwhile a covector is like a stack and it represents something with a direction and a density vectors are useful for giving geometric representations of things like position velocity acceleration momentum and force and covectors are useful for giving geometric representations of waves which have a direction and a density a wave covector's density and time is the wave's frequency and the covector's density in space is the wave's wave number if we take a space-time diagram and imagine a wave traveling left over time we can visualize the wave as a surface whose peaks travel left we can then trace lines over the wave peaks to get our wave covector stack which we'll call kappa if we have a sound source creating a wave in space time we can measure the sound wave's frequency in different frames just by counting how many covector surfaces are pierced by a reference frame's unit length basis vector for example einstein's time basis vector pierces two wave fronts so he observes a wave with a frequency of two hertz but the car's time vector pierces four wave fronts so it observes a frequency of four hertz this is according to galilean relativity where we only tilt the time axis to change between inertial frames for special relativity we use the lorentz transformation which causes the time and space axes to move together like a pair of scissors if einstein observes this light wave to have one frequency the car which is running toward the light source will pierce more wave fronts with its time basis vector so it observes a higher frequency meaning the light is blue shifted similarly if the car is running away from the light its time basis vector pierces fewer wave fronts and so it observes a lower frequency meaning the light is red-shifted from these geometric observations it's easy to derive the formula for the relativistic doppler shift of light as we did in relativity 106 a we even saw it was pretty easy to get the doppler shift formula for an accelerated observer in special relativity accelerated observers travel along hyperbolic world lines and each accelerated observer has their own rindler coordinate system with coordinates c t tilde and x tilde by comparing how many wave fronts are pierced by the hyperbolic world lines unit tangent vectors we got an exponential doppler shift formula for accelerated observers so now let's see how covectors can help us understand the redshift and blueshift of light due to gravity in the curved spacetime around a spherically symmetric non-rotating uncharged mass which is described by the short shield metric as a reminder in relativity 108 b we derived the space-time world lines of in-going and outgoing light beams along their radial direction with constant theta and phi coordinates we just took a tangent vector d by d lambda and set its squared length to be zero meaning it describes a lights-like vector then we plugged in the short shield metric and solved the resulting differential equation to get these world lines for light the world lines consist of a linear term and a log term the positive solutions are for outgoing light beams and the negative solutions are for ingoing light beams far away from the short shield radius rs the log term goes to zero so the light beams just look like diagonal lines on our space space-time diagram but close to the event horizon the log term dominates and the light beams appear to bunch up and go to infinity we can also think of these curves as representing the wave fronts on a single in-going or outgoing light beam since as a light beam travels left or right each of its individual wave fronts will follow a light-like trajectory unlike our last video on the doppler effect the wave fronts here are no longer positioned at a consistent angle their orientation changes depending on their location in space time to describe these wavefronts we need a co-vector field instead of a single covector to make a vector field we just draw a bunch of vectors whose directions and lengths change depending on their location in space time a co-vector field is the same thing but with covectors we just draw a bunch of covectors whose directions and densities change depending on their location in spacetime but how do we know which directions and densities to use in order to describe a light wave well remember when a co-vector acts on a vector the output is just the number of stack surfaces that the vector pierces if a vector is parallel to the stack the result is zero so if we can get the tangent vectors for these light-like world lines we just need to find the covector that's parallel to these tangent vectors and acts on the tangent vectors to give zero we can start with a tangent vector d by d lambda and expand it using multi-variable chain rule over c t and r we're ignoring theta and phi since this is a radial light beam remember partial derivatives of coordinate variables are just basis vectors we can choose the path parameter lambda to be anything we want so let's choose lambda equals r now for our outgoing light formula we see that dct by dr equals one over one minus rs over r and dr over dr is just plus one so this is our tangent vector field for outgoing light beams these components make sense since they point up and to the right which matches what we see on our space-time diagram as r goes to infinity these vectors point at a 45 degree angle as expected and as r approaches the short shield radius the time term dominates and the vectors point almost completely upward they also have a squared length of 0 as expected for lights-like vectors now let's find a co-vector field kappa that eats this vector field and spits out zero remember covectors are linear so we can apply the covector to each term in the sum and then pull out the scaling constants kappa of e t is just the covector's time component kappa t and kappa of er is just the covector's radial component kappa r rearranging this equation we find that a covector field representing an outgoing light beam will have a ratio of kappa r to kappa t that equals this this is a co-vector field oriented to the upper left which matches what we expect as seen on our space-time diagram however we solve for this ratio between kappa r and kappa t it's still possible to scale both of them by some function alpha of t and r while still maintaining the same ratio so we don't yet have the complete solution for our light covector field yet so how can we determine what this alpha function is well first of all since the short shield solution is static over time we can assume that alpha only depends on r and doesn't depend on time and we can solve for alpha r by demanding that the covector field kappa has the property of being exact as things stand now we know the co-vectors in our co-vector field are oriented in the correct directions because they act on light like vectors to produce zero so they are oriented parallel to light beams what we don't know is whether or not we have the correct covector densities if we have the incorrect densities we could end up with a covector field where the stack surfaces don't join up properly while this is a mathematical possibility this doesn't make physical sense since the lines in our co-vector field represent the wave fronts of a light beam and the lines should all join up correctly a co-vector field where all the lines join up properly is called exact this is a covector field that can be generated by looking at the level sets of a scalar function this here is an example of a co-vector field that's exact it's basically the covector version of a conservative vector field which is a vector field that can be written as the gradient of a scalar function there are many ways to mathematically state a co-vector field is exact but i'm just going to say our 2d covector field is exact if its curl is 0. so our condition for an exact co-vector field in space time is that partial kappa r by partial time minus partial kappa t by partial r equals zero since kappa r doesn't depend on time this goes to zero so we're just left with the condition that the kappa t component which equals alpha of r has a zero r derivative this tells us that alpha of r must be a constant a plugging this in we now have a co-vector field representing a light wave with the correct orientations and densities the constant factor a changes the density but not the directions so we were lucky that our co-vector field already had the correct densities up to a constant multiplicative factor but we still needed to declare that the curl was zero to be absolutely certain that the covector field was exact the wave fronts joined up properly and the densities were correct we can also get another covector field for in-going light beams just by using the in-going light beam equations with the minus sign instead here our tangent vector fields point to the upper left and the corresponding covector field points to the upper right now that we have our covector fields for in-going and outgoing light waves in short shield geometry how can we use this to determine the redshift or blue shift of light due to gravity you might be tempted just to take the covector field for light and apply it to the time basis vector to get the waves frequency this is almost correct but remember an observer makes actual physical measurements using an orthonormal reference frame where each basis vector has a length of 1. this is because when measuring our covector field we need to know how many wavefronts go by in one unit of time so we need our time basis vector to have a length of 1. the time basis vector in short shield coordinates is not normalized to one recall the squared length of the e t basis vector is given by the gtt component of the metric which is one minus rs over r in order to normalize e t we just divide it by the square root of 1 minus rs over r this new time vector now has a length of 1. so we just put this new time vector into our wave covector and use linearity rules to pull everything out now remember when an epsilon basis covector acts on a basis vector when the two indices match we get a one and when the two indices are different we get zero so we see that this light wave has a frequency of one over the square root of one minus r s over r times a and technically this is actually the frequency divided by the speed of light c just as we multiply the time coordinate t by c to get the same units as x y z we need to divide the frequency by c to get consistent units with the xyz wave numbers so this is the frequency of our light wave and we see the frequency depends on r so observers at different r positions will measure different frequencies for a single beam of light depending on where they measure it so gravity which is the curvature of space-time around our mass does change the frequency of light depending on where you're observing the light from if we make r go to infinity this factor becomes one and we get a so far away from the mass this beam of light has a frequency of a times c hertz as we get closer to the short shield radius this same light beam will have a frequency that gets higher and higher approaching infinity what this means is that if we aim a light beam at a spherical mass stationary observers arranged in a line we'll see the same light beam have a frequency that's larger and larger the closer they are positioned to the event horizon so an in-going light beam from far away will appear to be blue shifted to stationary observers close to the mass it might seem strange that the frequency goes to infinity near the event horizon but remember a stationary observer near the event horizon has to apply a huge acceleration in order to maintain their constant position and the acceleration approaches infinity as the constant position r approaches rs conversely if a high frequency light beam starting close to the mass is released outward each constant position observer will see the same light beam have a lower and lower frequency the farther they are away from the short shield radius the frequency changes according to the exact same r-dependent formula as the inward light beams because the time component of the covector field is the same in both cases so for distant observers the frequency is red-shifted as r goes to infinity space-time becomes basically flat and the light beams frequency approaches a constant value of a so this formula lets us compare the frequency observed at infinity and the frequency observed by a stationary observer at constant position r for a single light beam but what if we wanted to compare the frequencies for two different stationary observers at constant positions r1 and r2 well we can just take their respective gravitational frequency shift formulas and then take their ratio after some canceling and algebra we see that this is the formula that determines how two observers at different constant positions near a mass measure the frequency of the same light beam the last thing i'll do in this video is compare how gravitational frequency shift and curved space space-time compares to doppler shift for accelerating observers in flat space time the equivalence principle tells us that there is no difference between an observer in deep space in an accelerating rocket and an observer sitting on a planet's surface in a uniform gravitational field however the equivalence principle only applies locally in mathematical terms this means the curved space time of general relativity can be approximated by the flat space time of special relativity that is tangent to the curved space time at a given point but as we move away from this point special relativity becomes a worse and worse approximation of general relativity so if someone is standing on a planet with the molecular forces of the planet's surface forcing them upward away from a geodesic this person's four acceleration vector would point upward locally this is equivalent to someone in deep space being inside an accelerating rocket this person's for acceleration vector would also point upward so locally these two situations are equivalent however non-locally these two situations are not equivalent the gravitational effects on a series of rockets hovering above a planet in curved space time are not equivalent to a series of accelerating spaceships in deep space in flat space time so when examining frequency shift effects non-locally gravitational frequency shift seen near a planet is not equivalent to the doppler frequency shift we see in accelerating spaceships in the relativity 105bv video we learned that accelerating spaceships and special relativity have hyperbolic world lines if two spaceships accelerate so that they have the same proper acceleration readings on their accelerometers in their own frames they will get farther and farther apart in order to maintain constant distances along a line of accelerating spaceships as measured in their own frames each ship must accelerate according to this formula inversely proportional to its x-tilde position each spaceship will travel along a hyperbolic world line but each hyperbola will get less and less curved in the direction of acceleration previously we measured these hyperbolas using the x tilde position coordinate and the ct tilde time coordinate which acts as a hyperbolic angle however we can redraw this space-time diagram in such a way that the rindler coordinates ct tilde and x-tilde form a grid and the hyperbolas become vertical lines in this coordinate system we measure space-time intervals using the rindler metric the rendler metric tells us about the time dilation experienced by these spaceships it says that proper time is proportional to the x tilde coordinate so this means that one second on the first spaceship corresponds to five seconds on the fifth spaceship if we're measuring along this line of simultaneity here now how does this compare to the case of a line of spaceships firing their rockets above a planet so that each one maintains a constant height above the planet because the spaceships are firing their rockets to hold their positions they will each measure a proper acceleration on their personal accelerometers according to newtonian gravity each ship would measure a value of gm over r squared on their accelerometer where m is the mass of the planet however if we calculate the proper acceleration according to general relativity we get the same result but multiplied by this factor which drives the proper acceleration to infinity near the short shield radius however since the short shield radius rs is very small for most planets and stars this is approximately equal to the newtonian result in either case note that the accelerometer readings change with one over position squared we also saw in relativity 108b that the short shield metric results in gravitational time dilation according to this formula so the case of accelerating spaceships in deep space and the case of spaceships hovering above a planet do have similarities in both cases the ships all measure proper accelerations that are decreasing in the direction of acceleration and in both cases the ships experience time dilation with time passing more quickly in the direction of acceleration however the two cases are not globally equivalent the ships in deep space have a proper acceleration formula that changes with one over position and the ships above the planet have a proper acceleration formula that changes with one over position squared they also have different time dilation formulas going back to frequency shift the frequency shift effect in both cases is similar with a beam of light being blue shifted according to observers on the left and the same beam of light being more redshifted according to observers on the right however the formulas for frequency shift are not equivalent again one falls off with one over position and the other changes with this square root formula so while an accelerating spaceship in deep space is locally equivalent to standing on a planet or firing your rockets to maintain a constant position above a planet globally the two cases measure different proper accelerations different time dilations and different frequency shifts so we cannot treat gravitational frequency shift and doppler frequency shift as globally equivalent also if you want to know where these formulas come from you can pause and look at these derivations for proper acceleration of a stationary body in short shield geometry we use the fact that the length of an observer's four velocity vector is c to derive the ut component then we compute the for acceleration using the covariant derivative of u in the direction of u plug in the connection coefficient solve for the four acceleration vector and then find its length to get the proper acceleration for the doppler shift for accelerating spaceships we can show the paths of light in riddler coordinates obey an exponential formula then we can calculate the light like tangent vectors d by d lambda then get a light covector field by forcing the covector to be parallel to the lights-like tangent vectors and forcing its curl to be zero so that the densities are consistent then we normalize the time basis vector and apply the covector field to it to get the formula for the frequency of a light beam as a function of position so to summarize this video since a co-vector is a stack of surfaces we can put a covector at every point in space-time to get a co-vector field the wave fronts of a light beam time can be represented by a co-vector field where the covector densities across time represent the light wave's frequency and the co-vector densities across space represent the light's wave number we calculated the covector field for a radial light beam in short shield geometry to be equal to this where a times c is the frequency value very far away from the mass in flat space time by applying this covector field to a time basis vector with a length of 1 we were able to determine that an observer at a constant position r measures the light to have this frequency basically the same light beam is measured to have a more redshifted frequency by stationary observers far from the mass and is measured to have a more blue shifted frequency by stationary observers closer to the mass we also compared the cases of accelerating spaceships in deep space and the accelerating spaceships above a spherical mass although frequency shift is observed in both cases the frequency shift in each case is different because accelerating and flat space time is globally different than maintaining a constant position above a spherical mass in curved space time remember light waves have no objective frequency value to get a light beams frequency for a specific observer we need to grab that observer's unit length time basis vector which represents one unit of time in their reference frame and count how many wave peaks are observed across that one unit of time this general approach allows us to understand frequency shift in all cases and in all reference frames
