now that we have the einstein field equations we're going to see how they predict the existence of black holes gravitational waves and the expansion of the universe if you like you can skip this video and cover these sections in any order but for the relativity 108 videos we're going to cover black holes using the short shield metric the short shield metric is the space-time metric for a spherically symmetric non-rotating mass that has no electric charge it's useful for describing the curvature of space-time near slowly rotating spherical bodies like planets and many stars it's also useful for describing space-time curvature near non-rotating black holes the short shield metric predicts gravitational time dilation the gravitational doppler effect the bending of light due to gravity shifting in the perihelion of orbits and the existence of black holes with an event horizon with a radius of rs which is also called the short shield radius the metric was first discovered by carl schwarzschild who published it only a few months after einstein's general relativity paper in 1915. schwartshield unfortunately died only a few months later while serving in the german army in world war 1. in this video 108 a we'll start by deriving the short shield metric from some starting assumptions then in 108 b we'll interpret what the metric means explaining gravitational time dilation and also explaining a black hole's event horizon in 108c we'll calculate the geodesics of the short shield metric which give the paths of light beams and massive bodies in the presence of gravity which includes the perihelion shift of orbits in 108 d we'll cover some alternative coordinate systems for the short shield geometry that make it easier to understand and in 108 e i'll cover the gravitational doppler effect i may also cover other topics like rotating black holes and the kermetric later when it comes to black hole solutions we can categorize them for electrically charged and uncharged black holes and rotating and non-rotating black holes we're going to look at the uncharged non-rotating case called the short shield solution so we're now going to find the short shield solution to the einstein field equations but what exactly does it mean to solve the einstein field equations it basically means we put in an energy momentum tensor t and solve for the metric g so we put in a description of the mass energy and momentum in space time and we get out a complete description of the geometry of space-time using the metric we can then solve the geodesic equation which will give us the paths of massive objects and light beams through curved space-time so we'll know how gravity affects mass and light so what type of energy momentum tensor will we use to get our space-time solution for a spherically symmetric mass well we know inside the earth we have mass and pressure so the energy momentum tensor inside the earth is non-zero but outside the earth we can assume space-time is approximately a vacuum so the energy momentum tensor is zero in this video we're just going to focus on space time in the exterior vacuum region only so we're going to set the energy momentum tensor in the einstein field equations to zero we're also going to set the cosmological constant to zero since it's basically negligible unless we're working at cosmological scales if we take the trace of what's left using the inverse metric to raise an index the trace of the richie tensor is the richie scalar and the trace of the four by four identity matrix is four so we end up with the richie scalar being zero so for a vacuum region the einstein field equations simplify to just the richie tensor being zero which we call a reachy flat spacetime now the vacuum outside the mass still involves curved spacetime because the riemann curvature tensor here is non-zero but the richie tensor is zero and this means there are no immediate changes in the volume of a group of test particles outside the earth as they move along geodesics we only get tidal forces that squash and stretch the test particles without causing any immediate changes in the volume so our job is to take this equation and solve for the components of the 4x4 space-time metric that describes the curved space time near a body of mass m we're also going to assume that as we move far away from the mass the effects of gravity become negligible and space-time becomes basically flat described by the minkowski metric now before i start solving for the metric i'm going to do a quick review of spherical coordinates you can look at the video timestamps to skip this section if you want since we're dealing with a spherically symmetric mass it's better to deal with space time in spherical coordinates so instead of using the space-time coordinates ct xyz we'll use ctr theta phi as defined here where r is the radius theta is the angle from the north pole or co latitude and phi is the angle of rotation around the vertical axis or longitude and as a reminder we'll sometimes denote these four space-time coordinates using the zero one two three indices where zero indicates time and one two three are the spatial dimensions and in summations when we use a greek summation index this refers to all four space time indices but if we use a latin or english letter for the summation index this just refers to the spatial indices without time if we change from the cartesian coordinate basis to the spherical coordinate basis using multivariable chain rule and calculate the dot products of the basis vectors we get these components for the metric tensor in spherical coordinates the spatial dot products have negative signs in front because in our mostly minus convention for the metric space like vectors have negative squared lengths remember the components of the metric tensor are just the dot products of the basis vectors in our space-time coordinate system so the metric tensor helps us measure lengths and angles in space-time so both of these metric tensor matrices represent flat minkowski space but one is for cartesian coordinates and the other is for spherical coordinates the reason you see coordinate variables like r and theta in the metric components is because the theta and phi basis vectors change length depending on their position in space for example the phi basis vector is bigger near the equator and both the theta and phi basis vectors get longer as we move away from the origin so this should be the metric far away from the mass as r approaches infinity and space time becomes flat but close to the mass the metric components of the curved space time are unknown we can use some assumptions to narrow down the exact form the metric components should take first we're going to assume that space-time is static the technically correct definition of static space-time involves a concept called killing vectors which i haven't covered yet so i'm going to use a simplified definition we'll take static space time to mean two things first the metric doesn't depend on time and second that space time is symmetric when we reverse the time coordinate this is like mirror symmetry across the time axis this guarantees the black hole isn't rotating because if we reversed time for a rotating black hole the gravitational effects due to rotation would also reverse direction since basis vectors are just partial derivatives with respect to a coordinate variable reversing the direction of the time coordinate also reverses the direction of the time basis vector this does not change the gtt metric component since the two new negative signs cancel out but it will change the sign of e t dotted with any of the e i space basis vectors since gti equals negative gti these metric components go to zero if we want spherical symmetry in space the theta and phi components of the metric should resemble the metric for a sphere of radius r however we also allow multiplication by a radial function c of r since this doesn't violate spherical symmetry i'm also going to make these terms negative since space like vectors have negative metric components in the mostly minus metric convention if we want the radial basis vector er to stick out normal to the sphere in the radial direction it must be perpendicular to both e theta and e phi so these dot products and metric components go to zero so under our assumptions so far the metric is diagonal the remaining gtt and grr components should only depend on the radial coordinate r if we want to maintain spherical symmetry so we'll call them a of r and negative b of r we're using a negative sign since this metric component corresponds to a space-like direction now to simplify things we can always redefine the radial coordinate r to be r tilde equals r times the square root of c of r and this would eliminate the function on the last two metric components however i'm not going to bother writing out r tilde everywhere so i'm just going to rewrite the new radial component as r instead just as a warning some texts might write these a and b functions as exponential functions instead they do this because they already know that getting the right answer involves using terms like partial a over a which becomes much simpler if you use exponential functions but i'm not going to bother using this exponent trick in this video so we've simplified the form of the metric as much as possible in order to solve for a of r and b of r we'll have to calculate the connection coefficients calculate the reachy tensor components and then force the metric to give us the results of newtonian gravity in the limit of low velocity and weak gravity and this will give us the short shield metric so let's start by calculating the connection coefficients there are 13 non-zero connection coefficients in the short shield solution and only nine of them are independent calculating them is pretty boring but necessary i'll start by solving for the connection coefficients with a zero upper index then a one upper index then the two and three upper indices so here's the standard formula for the connection coefficients since the metric is diagonal we can easily get the inverse metric just by taking the reciprocal of all of the diagonal elements denoted by g with the upper indices so here's the standard formula for the connection coefficients but since we know that our metric is diagonal its two indices always need to match if the components are to be non-zero so we can rewrite the sigma alpha inverse metric with repeated sigma sigma indices to make it diagonal and replace all other alpha indices with sigma so this is not a summation over sigma here it's just denoting that these two indices always need to be the same now let's look at the connection coefficients with zero on top with zero zero on the bottom all the time derivative terms go to zero since g zero zero doesn't depend on time so we get zero if both the lower indices are the same spatial index i these metric components here are not diagonal elements of the matrix and therefore they must be zero from now on i'm just going to cross out non-diagonal metric components without saying anything out loud since it's going to happen a lot this time derivative term is 0 since the metric components don't depend on time and if the lower indices are both spatial but not equal all the metric components are off diagonal so we get zero in the case where one lower index is time and the other is spatial this term survives g inverse 0 0 is 1 over a and g 0 0 is just a this spatial i derivative can be any of partial 1 partial 2 or partial 3 or in other words partial r partial theta or partial phi since the a of r function only depends on r only the partial r term gives a non-zero result so the lower 0 1 and 1 0 coefficients are non-zero but 0 2 and 0 3 go to zero so those are all the connection coefficients with a zero index up top now let's continue to the coefficients with a one on top for 0 0 on the bottom we get negative 1 over b here and the r derivative of a giving this 4 1 1 on the bottom these cancel and we get negative 1 over b times the r derivative of negative b with 2 2 on the bottom we get negative 1 over b and the r derivative of r squared which is just 2r so we get negative r over b and for the 3 3 on the bottom we get the same thing multiplied by sine squared when one of the lower indices is 1 all the coefficients go to zero either because they're off-diagonal or constant with respect to a derivative any other mixed lower indices give all off-diagonal metric components so they go to zero two so these are all the non-zero coefficients with one on top for the two on top coefficients having zero zero one one or two two on the bottom all give zero but three three on the bottom gives us negative 1 over r squared for the inverse 2 2 components and the derivative with respect to theta of the 3 3 component the negative 1 over r squared and negative r squared cancel and the derivative of sine squared is two sine times cosine if one of the lower indices is two then having one two on the bottom gives us a non-zero term which simplifies to one over r any other mix of indices on the bottom all go to zero so these are all the non-zero coefficients with two on top finally for the three on top coefficients if we have repeated lower indices that are not three the off diagonals go to zero and the last term goes to zero since the metric components don't depend on phi and the three three lower indices go to zero as well because nothing depends on phi for zero three on the bottom we get zero for one three on the bottom we get the derivative of g three three with respect to r which is non-zero canceling sine squared and turning through the derivative and algebra we get one over r for 2 3 on the bottom g3 depends on theta and canceling r squared and working through gives us cosine over sine which is the definition of cotangent all the other mixed lower indices go to zero so now we have all nine of the independent non-zero connection coefficients and even though i'm using the mostly minuses metric all of these coefficients should be the same in both the mostly minus and mostly plus metric conventions and if you want to view these connection coefficients as arrays they would look like this so given these connection coefficients we're now going to calculate the formulas for r00 r11 and r22 remember our einstein field equations tell us that all the components of the richey tensor are equal to zero we'll see that these three equations will be enough to solve for our a and b functions remember given the riemann tensor the richie tensor is just the riemann tensor with its upper and lower middle indices summed together so that zero zero richie component looks like this now there are a lot of summations here like the summations over mu alpha and beta but it will turn out a lot of these summation terms go to zero for each of the four terms here we need to look at the non-zero connection coefficients and decide what the non-zero coefficients in these summations are for example the first term has two zero indices on the bottom of the connection coefficient and there's only a single non-zero connection coefficient with two zero indices on the bottom which is the one zero zero coefficient so this means that even though the mu index is technically summed from 0 to 3 only the mu equals 1 term stays around with this second term here there are actually no coefficients with 0 on the lower right with the other two indices matching so it goes to zero for the third term looking at the alpha index with two zeros on the bottom alpha must be one for this to be non-zero and for the fourth term looking at the beta index we see that beta could be 0 or 1 but not 2 or 3. so the beta summation expands to two terms we still have some mu summations left here mu could be either 0 1 2 or 3. so this expands to 4 terms for the last two summations mu must equal 1 in the first summation and mu must equal zero in the second summation now this conveniently cancels with this and since the two two one and three three one coefficients are equal i'm going to group them as two times the same term we're now ready to sub in the formulas for the connection coefficients most of these we can just multiply together but this derivative term with the one coordinate which is the r coordinate involves product rule for the product of partial r a and the reciprocal of b we get the second partial derivative of a in the first term and use power rule on b to the negative one to get b to the negative two times negative one times a chain rule derivative term rewriting we get this now remember all of this is equal to zero since the reachy tensor is zero in our solution to make this easier to read i'm going to replace the partial derivative of a with respect to r with a prime and replace the partial derivative of b with respect to r with b prime i'm also going to multiply the equation by a common denominator of 4 a b squared r to get rid of the denominators so that was r 0 0. for r 1 1 and r 2 2 i'm just going to run through them quickly you can pause the video if you want to check the algebra for r11 we have mu equals 1 here and expansion to 4 terms alpha equals 1 here and expansion to 4 terms we get another expansion to four terms and mu equals zero one two three for the rest then we do some canceling and grouping of like terms after subbing in the coefficient formulas we need to do product rule on the first term and use power rule on one over r to get one over r squared times negative one we can then do some cancelling and combine terms and we multiply by four a squared b r to get rid of the denominators for r two two we have mu equals one mu equals three alpha equals one and beta equals one two three this sum expands to four terms and then we have mu equals two mu equals one and mu equals three then we cancel and factor like terms after we sub in the formulas we have to do the product rule on r times b to the negative one and also cotangent which is just cosine times sine to the negative one so we have product rule and product rule this is just plus one and this is cotangent squared so we cancel distribute combine and multiply by two times a b squared to get rid of the denominators so all these richie components equal zero this means that if we add r 0 0 and r 1 1 the result should be 0. if we sum these terms in r 0 0 and r 1 1 these cancel these cancel and these cancel so we get four a b a prime plus four a squared b prime equals zero if we cancel four a from both terms we get b a prime plus a b prime this is just the product rule results from the derivative of a times b and since this derivative is 0 this tells us that a times b is a constant which i'll call capital k now we know that as the short shield metric goes out to r equals infinity it will approach the flat minkowski metric where a equals one and b equals one so in this limit a times b equals k becomes 1 times 1 equals k and since k is the same constant for all r values k equals 1 for all r this means that b equals 1 over a for all r so knowing the r 2 2 formula and that b equals 1 over a and that b prime is the derivative of 1 over a which is negative a prime over a squared we can substitute in for b and b prime if we cancel factors of a and add these together cancel the twos and rearrange we get the differential equation r times a prime equals 1 minus a the solution to this equation is a of r equals 1 minus a constant small k over r if we calculate the derivative of a we find that it's k over r squared and if we plug a prime and a into our differential equations cancel here ones cancel here and we get k over r equals k over r so this solution satisfies the differential equation so we've solved for a of r equals 1 minus k over r and b is just 1 over a so we have the form of the short shield metric now we just need to solve for the constant k which ends up being 2 gm over the speed of light squared this is called the schwartshield radius or the event horizon of the black hole we can solve for the lowercase k constant by forcing the short shield metric to reproduce newtonian gravity in the limit of low velocity and weak gravity for this part of the video i'm going to use the minkowski metric in cartesian coordinates instead of spherical coordinates i showed in relativity 107f during the derivation of the einstein field equations that we can force the geodesic equation to match the newtonian equation for acceleration due to gravity in the limit of low velocity the proper time is approximately equal to the coordinate time t and an object's four velocity vector components are dominated by the time component which is basically c with the other components going to zero to get the geodesic equation to match newtonian acceleration we need the i zero zero connection coefficient to be one over c squared times the partial derivative of the gravitational potential phi in the i direction now when we say we're taking the limit of weak gravity this means that the metric can be written as a sum of the flat minkowski metric eta plus a small change h where the components of h are much less than one this basically means that when we do a summation with the metric the h part is small enough to be ignored but when we take the derivative of the metric we ignore the constant minkowski part in cartesian coordinates and only get the derivative of the h part so if we take the formula for the connection coefficients and look at the i zero zero case this inverse metric can be approximated by the flat minkowski metric and these metric derivatives are equal to the derivative of the h part and since the metric is diagonal we know this alpha index must match the spatial index i if we want the components to be non-zero the first two terms are off-diagonal and go to zero and the space diagonal elements of the minkowski metric are all negative one in cartesian coordinates so we're left with gamma i zero zero equals one half times partial i of h zero zero but recall that gamma i zero zero is just one over c squared partial i of the gravitational potential if we remove the derivatives on both sides we see that h00 is just two times the gravitational potential over c squared in newtonian gravity the gravitational potential for a spherical body of mass m is negative g times m over r this is what gives us the standard newton's law of gravity after taking the gradient and multiplying by a second mass so h 0 0 equals negative 2 g m over c squared r so since we've solved for h h00 in cartesian coordinates we've also solved for h00 in spherical coordinates since both coordinate systems use the same time coordinate comparing this to the form of the g00 component of the metric that we've derived the constant small k must then be equal to 2 gm over c squared which we can plug into the formula for the g11 component as well this component 2g m over the speed of light squared is also called the short shield radius and is often denoted by r subscript s this completes the derivation of the short shield metric one last thing before i conclude a few slides ago some people might point out that canceling derivatives on both sides here doesn't make sense and the correct thing to do is to integrate both sides which gives an additional constant of integration giving this for h00 and this for g00 but since we want the metric to reduce to the flat minkowski metric as r goes to infinity we're forced to set this integration constant to zero this is similar to how the newtonian gravitational potential negative gm over r can also have an extra constant added onto it because the constant goes away when we take the gradient this constant is the potential's value at infinity so this value must be zero if we want the potential to be zero infinitely far from the mass so to summarize this video we derived the short shield metric which is the space-time metric for a spherically symmetric uncharged non-rotating mass together with the additional assumption that space-time is static meaning in our coordinate system the metric doesn't depend on time and also space time doesn't change when we reverse the direction of the time coordinate this solution is only valid in the vacuum region outside the mass not within the mass itself and we also treats the cosmological constant as being negligible in the next video we're going to interpret what this metric means and we'll see how it results in gravitational time dilation how it affects light and how the short shield radius rs is interpreted to be the event horizon of a black hole which is a radius beyond which light can never escape
