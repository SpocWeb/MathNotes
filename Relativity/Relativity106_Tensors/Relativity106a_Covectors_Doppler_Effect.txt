in the relativity 106 videos we're going to introduce tensors tensors are mathematical tools that are important for studying relativity because they help us write the laws of physics in a way that's the same in all coordinate systems in this video we'll start by introducing covectors which are a very important type of tensor just like vectors and then we'll apply covectors to the doppler effect in relativity in future videos we'll give the definition of a tensor and talk about the tensor product so in relativity a vector is basically like an arrow and a vector is used to represent something with a direction and a size meanwhile a co-vector is basically like a stack and it represents something with a direction and a density we've already seen how vector arrows can give us geometrical representations of position velocity acceleration momentum and force in both 3d space and 4d space time in this video we'll see that covectors can give us a geometrical representation of waves which basically have a density and time called frequency and a density in space called the wavenumber this will help us give a geometrical interpretation of the doppler effect so in the first part of this video we're going to discuss co-vectors from the point of view of pure mathematics then we'll apply this to the doppler effect in galilean relativity then special relativity in inertial frames and then special relativity in non-inertial frames i cover co-vectors more slowly in my tensors for beginners videos 4 5 and 6 so you can check the description for links to those videos if you already understand co-vectors you can skip ahead to this part of the video and go straight to the doppler effect so a covector is an oriented stack that eats a vector as input and then outputs a number so here is a covector stack in 2d oriented in this direction and here is a covector in 3d oriented in this direction so let's say that we have a vector called v and a covector called alpha when alpha takes v as input this outputs alpha of v which is just the number of stacks pierced by the vector v when we lay it over top of the covector alpha so if we look here the vector v pierces one two three stacks of alpha so alpha of v is equal to three in this example v pierces one two stacks of alpha so alpha of v is equal to two in this example v pierces one stack line but gets halfway to the second stack line so we say that alpha of v is equal to 1.5 so the result of alpha of v is non-integer if the arrow makes it part way between the stacks over here v pierces 1 2 stacks of alpha but this is pointing in the opposite direction of alpha's orientation given by these arrows so we say that alpha of v is negative two instead of positive two so the result of alpha of v can be negative if the vector arrow points in the direction opposite of the stack and finally here the vector v doesn't pierce any stacks at all so alpha of e is equal to zero so the result of alpha of v can be zero if the vector arrow is parallel to the stack lines now let's study some of the properties of covectors with this covector alpha and this vector v we see that v pierces seven stack lines so alpha of e is equal to seven and in the case of the vector u u pierces three stack lines so alpha of u equals three and w pierce's four stack lines so alpha of w equals four now notice that these three vectors form a triangle and they obey the equation v equals u plus w notice that it's also true that alpha of v which is seven equals alpha of u which is three plus alpha of w which is four so this is our first geometrical property of covector stacks when alpha acts on a sum of vectors alpha of u plus w this is equal to the sum of alpha acting on the individual vectors alpha of u plus alpha of w so when it comes to a co-vector acting on a sum of vectors we can either add the inputs or add to the outputs and we'll get the same result now in this example v pierces three stack lines so alpha v equals three now watch what happens if we double the length of v to get two v the vector two v pierces six stack lines so alpha of two v equals 6. notice that when we double the length of the input vector this is the same thing as doubling the output of alpha acting on the original vector so this is another property of covectors we can either scale the input vector or scale the output by the same scalar n and we'll get the same results so these two properties are the fundamental laws of covactors we can either add the inputs or add to the outputs of covectors and get the same results and we can either scale the inputs or scale the outputs of covectors and get the same results when we apply these two properties together when we have alpha acting on a linear combination a u plus b w we can split alpha to each term in the sum and then bring these scalars outside to get a alpha of u plus b alpha of w so for covectors we can either do linear combinations of inputs or linear combinations of outputs with the same scaling constants and we'll get the same results this is a very useful fact because if we have alpha of v and then we expand v as a linear combination of a basis e x and e y with components v x and v y we can split alpha across the two sum terms and then bring the vector components outside so if we want to know how alpha acts on an arbitrary vector v all we really need to know is how alpha acts on the basis vectors e x and e y if we know how alpha acts on a basis e x e y then we know how it acts on any vector v we call alpha of e x and alpha of e y the components of alpha in the e x e y basis and we write them as alpha x and alpha y with subscripts now something we've learned in past videos is that vector components are contravariant if we have a vector v measured in the basis e x e y we see that v is equal to one copy of e x plus one copy of e y now if we change the basis vectors to make them twice as big and get e x tilde e y tilde then we can write the same vector v as one half e x tilde plus one half e y tilde when the basis vectors get twice as big the components of v get twice as small and become one-half one-half vector components will always change in the opposite way that basis vectors do so we call vector components contra-variant now let's look at what happens to covector components when we change bases so looking at this covector alpha when we measure its components using the ex and ey basis vectors we see that ex pierces two stack lines so alpha of e x or alpha x is two and e y also pierces two stack lines so alpha of e y or alpha y also equals two now again let's double the length of the basis vectors to get e x tilde and e y tilde now e x tilde pierces four stacks so alpha of e x tilde or alpha x tilde is equal to four and e y tilde also pierces four stacks so alpha of e y tilde or alpha y tilde is also equal to four notice that when we doubled the length of the basis vectors the size of the covector components also doubled this means that covector components are covariant because they change in the same way that basis vectors do if the basis vectors become twice as big then co-vector components will also become twice as big so given that we build vectors using basis vectors scaled and added in linear combination you might wonder if there's a basis for covectors as well and it turns out that there is we call a basis for covectors the dual basis and we write it using the greek letter epsilon the dual basis vector epsilon x is defined in such a way that when it acts on e x we get one and when it acts on any other basis vector in the same basis we get zero so this means that the covector epsilon x looks like this e x pierces one stack line and e y doesn't pierce any stack lines similarly the basis covector epsilon y is defined so that when it acts on e y we get 1 and when it acts on any other basis vector we get 0. so epsilon y looks like this ey pierces one stack line and ex pierces no stack lines when basis covectors are taken in linear combination the rule for addition is to add the densities together so if we have 2 epsilon x plus 1 epsilon y what this is saying is that the resulting co-vector will have a density in the x-direction of two and a density in the y-direction of one so this resulting co-vector alpha has the e-x basis vector pierce 2 stacks and has the e y basis vector pierce 1 stack so its density in the x direction is 2 and its density in the y direction is 1. we can confirm this algebraically by having alpha act on the e x basis vector so alpha is really 2 epsilon x plus 1 epsilon y and we can pass the input e x to each of these basis covectors epsilon x of e x is one by definition and epsilon y of e x is zero so we get that the density in the x direction is two as expected and following a similar process for e y we get that the density in the ey direction is 1 as expected it turns out that the epsilon basis covectors are contravariant the epsilon x basis covector that is dual to the basis vector e x satisfies these properties when we double the length of the e x e y basis to get e x tilde e y tilde the new dual basis covector epsilon x tilde must now satisfy these properties where e x tilde pierces it once and e y tilde doesn't pierce it at all to do this epsilon x tilde must become half as dense as epsilon x the same is true for epsilon y tilde since the epsilons transform in the opposite way that basis vectors do we call them contravariant it makes sense that covector components are covariant written in a row and basis covectors are contravariant written with a column we can transform the components with one matrix and then transform the basis with the inverse matrix leaving the covector invariant so to summarize covectors from a pure mathematics point of view covectors are like stacks they eat vector inputs and output numbers the output of alpha of v is the number of stacks pierced by the vector v and the two fundamental covector laws tell us that we can either add inputs or add outputs and get the same result and we can scale inputs or scale outputs and get the same results also for any vector basis ex and ey vectors have a dual basis given by epsilon x and epsilon y and the dual basis is defined such that when an epsilon basis covactor acts on its partner basis vector we get one and if it acts on any other basis vector we get 0. also the components of a covector are given by counting how many stack lines are pierced by the basis vectors also note that basis vectors and covector components change in the same way which means covector components are covariant but basis vectors and bases covectors change in opposite ways so basis covectors are contravariant and one last thing if vectors live in a vector space v we say their partner covectors live in the vector space v star called the dual space now let's look at a practical application of co-vectors in physics which is understanding the doppler effect in both the relativistic and non-relativistic cases first let's look at the properties of waves let's say that we have a wave like this that's traveling through space in the positive x direction let's say that we take a photograph of the wave so that it is frozen in time and we can look at how the wave changes over space in the x direction we say that the distance between wave peaks in the x direction is called the x wavelength and we denote it by lambda x we can also count the number of wave peaks per unit distance in the x direction and we call this the linear wave number denoted by kappa x and it is equal to the reciprocal of the wavelength there is also the angular wave number k which is 2 pi times the linear wave number but we will not be using the angular wave number very much in this video [Music] let's again look at our traveling wave but instead let's focus on the wave at a single point of constant x over time we can see that at our point of constant position the wave makes a periodic up and down motion so we can also look at how a wave changes over time at a specific position the time between wave peaks at a constant position is called the period denoted by capital t we can also count the number of wave peaks per unit time and we call this the linear frequency denoted by f and this is equal to the reciprocal of the period there is also the angular frequency omega which is 2 pi times the linear frequency but again we won't be using the angular frequency very much in this video technically speaking the y and z directions also have their own wave numbers but i'm going to assume they are zero for this video and just focus on a wave traveling in the x direction so our wave is changing in both space and time and it can be tricky to visualize this the easiest way to visualize a wave is on a space-time diagram if we have a wave that's moving to the left we can take a photograph of the wave at each second and arrange all these photographs together in a space-time diagram to get a 2d visualization of the wave we can now see how the wave is changing in both time and space we know that this wave is moving to the left since if we follow any peak on the wave we see that it is traveling left as we move into the future the speed of the wave is given by how much distance one of these peaks covers in a unit of time and it is equal to the frequency divided by the wave number this has units of distance over time which is what we expect for speed we can simplify this diagram just by drawing lines that represent wave peaks but we can still see that the wave is traveling left and we can still see how often it changes in time and space so our wave can be drawn on a space-time diagram as a stack or a co-vector we call this the wave co-vector or sometimes the frequency wave number covector we denote this wave covector by the greek letter kappa without any subscripts we can use the wave covector to understand the doppler effect geometrically the doppler effect basically says that when we run towards the source of a wave its frequency gets higher and if we run away from the source of the wave its frequency gets lower let's say that we have a stationary sound wave generator that is producing a wave that moves to the left einstein is also stationary positioned some distance away to measure this wave co-vector all we have to do is use einstein's space-time basis vectors e t and e-x the wave's frequency is just its density and time which is just the wave covector kappa acting on the time basis vector e t and the wave's wave number is just its density in space which is just the wave covector kappa acting on the e x basis vector we see that the time basis vector pierces one two stacks so this wave's frequency is two and the space basis vector pierces one two three four stacks so the wave's wave number is four the waves speed is just frequency over wave number which is two over four or one half meters per second this is all according to einstein the e t and e x basis lets us measure space time from einstein's frame of reference but what if we looked from the frame of reference of this car traveling in the positive x direction relative to einstein with a speed of v how would the car measure this wave all we need to do is measure this wave again using the car's space-time basis e t tilde and e-x tilde e t tilde just points along the direction of the car's world line and e x tilde is the exact same as e x the car's time basis vector pierces one two three four stacks so the wave's density in time or its frequency is 4 according to the car and the car's space basis vector also pierces 4 stacks so the wave's density in space or wavenumber is 4. the waves speed according to the car is frequency over wave number which is 4 divided by 4 or 1 meter per second so we've seen that the waves frequency and speed change depending on the observer since the car is running towards the wave source the wave appears to have a larger frequency and a larger speed according to the car we worked this out by drawing pictures and counting the number of co-vector stacks pierced by a space-time basis but we can also figure this out using algebra recall the galilean transformation of the space-time basis that we learned in relativity 103. the car's time basis vector equals einstein's time basis vector plus the car's velocity times einstein's x-basis vector and the car's x basis vector is exactly equal to einstein's x basis vector if we want to know how many wave stacks the car's e t tilde basis vector pierces we can just substitute this formula for e t tilde and by the fundamental covactor laws we can move addition and scaling outside the co vector so we now have a formula to get the frequency of the wave in the cars frame it's just the frequency measured by einstein plus the speed of the car according to einstein times the wave number according to einstein we can also get a similar formula for the wave number conversion measured from the car's perspective notice how these formulas for converting frequency and wave number to the cars frame look very similar to the formulas for converting to the car's basis vectors this is because covector components are covariant and they transform in the exact same way as basis vectors if we remember the formula for a wave's speed we get that einstein's wavenumber equals einstein's frequency divided by einstein's wave speed if we sub this in this results in the doppler shift formula you might see in school textbooks and if we plug in the values for the wave frequency wave speed and car speed according to einstein we get that the car measures a frequency of 4 hertz as expected so what we just covered was the doppler effect in galilean relativity which used the galilean transformation of the basis vectors now let's look at the doppler effect in special relativity which uses the lorentz transformation of space-time basis vectors recall that beta is just the fraction of the speed of light v over c and gamma is just one over the square root of one minus beta squared if you'll recall in special relativity we usually measure time in meters by multiplying the time measured with seconds by the speed of light c this lets us treat time and space on equal footing because they are both measured in meters from the point of view of an inertial frame wave peaks for a light beam on a space-time diagram will always travel at 45 degrees which represents the speed of light this means that for a light wave the speed of light c is always equal to light's frequency divided by its wave number in other words f over c equals kappa x for a light wave for convenience we will denote f over c by kappa t and we call this quantity the time wave number while frequency f is measured in hertz or reciprocal seconds the time wave number kappa t is measured in reciprocal meters just like the wave number in the x direction kappa x this basically puts frequency and time and wave number in space on equal footing because they are both measured in reciprocal meters let's say that einstein measures a light wave where the density in time or the time wave number kappa t is 2. for light beams with speed c kappa t and kappa x are always equal to each other if we assume that the wave is not moving in the y and z directions so this means that the density in space kappa x is also 2 in einstein's frame but what would the time and space wave numbers be for the wave measured in the car's frame if the car is moving towards the wave source at one half the speed of light so for the car beta equals one-half and gamma equals two over the square root of three the density and time for the car is just the wave co-vector kappa acting on the car's time basis vector we can sub in the basis change formula from the lorentz transformation to write this in terms of kappa acting on the einstein space-time basis we get that the car's time wave number kappa t tilde is einstein's time wave number plus beta times einstein's x-wave number all multiplied by gamma we can get a similar formula for getting the car's x-wave number kappa x-tilde again the form of these transformation equations exactly matches the form of the change of basis under the lorenz transformation since the wave covector components are covariant we can take this formula and turn it into a version that's more commonly seen in relativity textbooks we can replace kappa x with kappa t since they are always equal for light waves that are not moving in the y or z directions and then factor out kappa t we can also replace gamma with one over the square root of one minus beta squared the one plus beta on top can be rewritten as the square root of one plus beta times the square root of one plus beta and since the bottom involves a difference of squares we can rewrite it as the square root of one minus beta times the square root of one plus beta we can then cancel the square root of one plus beta from the top and bottom so we can see that the conversion factor between the car's time wave number and einstein's time wave number is the square root of one plus beta over one minus beta this also applies to the conversion between frequencies since the time wave number is just the frequency over c if we plug in 2 for einstein's time wave number and one half for beta we see that the time wave number measured by the car is 2 times the square root of 3 or about 3 and a half which matches our diagram so if a frame that's standing still measures a light wave to have a frequency f a frame running towards the light wave source will measure a higher frequency we call this effect blue shift because the frequency shifts to the higher end of the electromagnetic spectrum represented by blue light similarly if a frame is running away from the light source it will measure a lower frequency we call this redshift because the frequency shifts to the lower end of the electromagnetic spectrum represented by red light the last thing we'll do in this video is to look at the doppler effect for an accelerating frame or to be more technically correct a frame that measures constant proper acceleration on an accelerometer that they are carrying with them i already showed in relativity 105 a b and c that the world line of an observer with constant proper acceleration alpha is given by a hyperbola with these being the equations for ct and x in the accelerating observer's riddler coordinate system ct tilde and x tilde where the distance capital d is c squared over alpha i also showed that at every point along this hyperbola the accelerating observer has a different space-time basis where the time basis vector is tangent to the world line and the x-basis vector is mankowski orthogonal to it in relativity 105 e we showed how to change the basis in curvilinear coordinates by equating basis vectors with partial derivatives and using multivariable chain rule to get the components of a basis vector so from that video we already know that the time basis vector in riddler coordinates looks like this so to get the time wave number that the rindler observer measures we just apply kappa to the rindler time basis vector and replace it with this formula so we get that the rindler's time wavenumber equals x tilde over d times cosh times einstein's time wave number plus x tilde over d times cinch times einstein's x-wave number since kappa x equals kappa t we can factor out kappa t to the front then we can replace kosh and cinch with their exponential representations where cosh is one-half times the sum of a positive and negative exponential and cinch is one-half times the subtraction of a positive and negative exponential the negative exponentials cancel and we're left with the conversion factor between riddler and einstein's time wave numbers depending on both time and space with this exponential in the case of rindler's hyperbolic world line he has a constant x tilde coordinate of d so d over d just goes to one and we find that the frequency conversion only depends on time we find that at very negative times far in the past rindler sees a frequency of almost zero because he is running away from the source of the wave very fast then at time equals zero the conversion factor is just one this means that rindler sees the same frequency as einstein because they are both momentarily stationary with respect to each other at this one instant in time then at very positive times far into the future rindler sees a frequency that approaches infinity because he is running towards the source of the wave very fast so an observer accelerating towards a light source will observe continuous blue shift where the light waves frequency gets higher and higher and an observer accelerating away from a light source will observe continuous redshift where the light waves frequency gets lower and lower so to summarize the geometrical interpretation of the doppler effect we can think of a traveling wave as a covector stack in space-time the density of the stack in the time direction gives us the time wave number which is the frequency over the speed of light and the density of the stack in the x-direction gives us the x-wave number these give the components of the frequency wave number covector also called the wave co-vector technically speaking we can also add the y and z wave numbers to get a full four dimensional space-time wave co-vector to find out how different reference frames measure the frequency and wave number of the wave we just measure the densities of the wave co-vector using the space-time basis for that reference frame because the wave covector components are covariant they transform in the exact same way that basis vectors do in galilean relativity this gives us the standard galilean doppler effect formula in special relativity with inertial frames this gives us the relativistic doppler effect for light waves and in special relativity with accelerating frames we can see that light has continuous blue shift or redshift over time depending on whether the observer is accelerating toward or away from the light source
