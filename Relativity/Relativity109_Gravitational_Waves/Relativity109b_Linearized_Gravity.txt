in this video we're going to start the mathematical derivation of gravitational waves by talking about linearized gravity which is when we approximate the space time metric g as the flat minkowski metric eta plus a small change h where the components of h are much smaller than the components of eta meaning they are much smaller than one in cartesian coordinates over the next few videos we'll see that gravitational waves are disturbances in this h term so gravitational waves are essentially small vibrations in the metric deviating away from flat space time our goal for this video is to calculate the form of all the terms on the left hand side of the einstein field equations under the linearized gravity condition this will involve calculating the inverse metric the connection coefficients the riemann tensor the richie tensor and the richie scalar so before we start i want to go over exactly what we mean by linearized gravity also called weak gravity i touched on this a little in my 108 a video but i was a bit sloppy and i'd like to correct myself for linearized gravity we write the metric g as the flat minkowski metric eta in cartesian coordinates which is this matrix here plus a small change h when i say h is small i mean that any term involving h squared is so extremely small that it can be neglected and set to zero now there's another assumption of linearized gravity that is often left out of textbooks and this is the assumption that the derivatives of h are also very small this means that terms involving the derivative of h squared or terms involving the product of h and the derivative of h are extremely small and can be set to zero i've almost never seen this property about the derivatives of h being small stated explicitly in most general relativity notes but all the derivations i've seen in weak gravity seem to assume this property is true implicitly so in my videos i'm going to be working under the assumption that linearized gravity means h is small and the derivatives of h are small so we know the metric g with lower indices is the minkowski metric eta plus a small change h the inverse metric with upper indices is basically the metric inverse of the metric matrix which gives the four by four identity matrix or chronic or delta when we multiply the metric and inverse metric together in a summation we can assume the inverse metric g is the inverse minkowski metric with upper indices plus a different small change k with upper indices if we plug these into this equation and distribute we can replace the summation of the metric and the inverse metric with a chronicle delta and also replace this summation of the eta and inverse eta with a chronicler delta then cancel the chronicle deltas since we know that the components of both h and k are small the product of h and k should be extremely small so we can ignore it this leaves us with h eta inverse equaling negative eta k if we sum both sides with eta inverse on the left side eta and eta inverse sum to a chronic delta which changes this sigma index into a row index so we've solved for the k components in terms of h components k equals negative h with two summations with the inverse minkowski metric since the metric is used to raise and lower indices we can treat these two minkowski metrics as raising the mu and sigma indices on this h giving us negative h with raised indices so the inverse metric g is just the inverse minkowski metric minus h with raised indices where h with raised indices is just h with lowered indices summed with two inverse etas it's important to remember that the metrics g and eta with upper indices are actually the inverse metrics and some to give a chronic delta but h with upper indices is not inverse h instead h with upper indices is h with indices that have been raised with metric tensors normally we would raise indices with the g metric but since h is small the product of two h's goes to zero so we can raise the indices of h using the adametric only now let's calculate the connection coefficients using the standard formula involving the metric we'll need to take partial derivatives of the metric g this is really just taking the derivative of eta plus h and since eta is constant its derivative is zero so for linearized gravity the derivative of g can always be replaced by the derivative of h and we can do that replacement in our connection coefficient formula now remember the inverse metric g can be written as the inverse etametric minus h with raised indices if we distribute you'll notice that we get several terms that are a product of h and the derivative of h remember according to our linearized gravity condition both h and the derivative of h are taken to be small so their product is extremely small and can be ignored so all these terms go to zero so in linearized gravity the connection coefficient formula looks like this the derivatives of g are replaced by derivatives of h and the inverse g is replaced by an inverse eta now let's calculate the riemann tensor the formula for the riemann tensor has two types of terms the derivatives of the connection coefficients and products of the connection coefficients remember the connection coefficient is made up of terms that contain the derivative of h so when we multiply two connection coefficients together we're going to get a series of terms that involve the product of two h derivatives again in linearized gravity we take the derivative of h to be small this means that the product of two h derivatives is extremely small and can be ignored so in linearized gravity in the formula for the riemann tensor we ignore the terms involving products of the connection coefficients because these are extremely small and can be ignored so the riemann tensor formula simplifies to the difference of two connection coefficient derivatives if we sub in for the formulas for the connection coefficients we can distribute the partial derivatives and pull the one-half eta out in front leaving us with six terms of two partial derivatives each since the order of partial derivatives doesn't matter this partial mu partial new term cancels with this partial new partial mu term so we're left with a formula with four terms next we'll calculate the richie tensor which is just the riemann tensor with its upper and lower middle indices summed together so to get the reachy tensor we'll take our riemann tensor formula and change this upper index to a mu this eta with upper mu alpha indices can raise all the alpha indices inside the brackets to upper muse and raise the final mu to an alpha now we already said in the last video that the dial and bear operator which is the square is just two partial derivatives summed with the metric or equivalently a lower index partial summed with an upper index partial also we're going to make a new definition called the h scalar which is the h components with one upper index and one lower index summed with itself so this is sort of like the trace of the h matrix so we can take these first two terms as they are replace this with the dalam bear operator and replace this with the h scalar and this gives us our formula for the richie tensor in linearized gravity finally we'll look at the richie scalar which is just the reachy tensor with one raised index summed with itself with the index being raised by eta if we sub in our reachy tensor formula we can use the eta outside to raise all the new indices to become sigmas this h tensor summed over itself can be rewritten as the scalar h and two partial derivatives with raised and lowered indices can be rewritten as the square dalembere operator and since we can always relabel summation indices wherever we like as long as we relabel them consistently we can relabel this alpha index with a sigma so we're left with one half of two of the same term minus two of the same term so we can just take one of each term and drop the one half so the richie scalar in linearized gravity is the second partial derivative of h with raised indices minus the dilem version of the h scalar now that we know the richie tensor the metric tensor and the richie scalar formulas for linearized gravity we can get the formula for the einstein tensor capital g we just plug all our formulas in again since the g metric is really eta plus h and the product of h with either h or a derivative of h is considered extremely small we can ignore the h part of the metric here and just write the metric as eta distributing the eta for the last two terms and factoring one-half from all six terms we get this now here we have some h's with lowered indices some with upper indices and some with mixed indices it's more convenient to have all of our h's with lowered indices since a raised index is really just a shorthand notation for a lowered index summed with an inverse metric we can feel free to take a raised index pop out the inverse metric and then use it to raise the index of another term instead so basically it's acceptable to lower one index in a summation if we raise its partner index to compensate so we can exchange these alphas these alphas and both alpha and beta here and now all our h indices are lowered now it's possible to tidy up this expression by making a definition for the components h bar which are the h components minus one half eta times the h scalar or alternatively the h components equal the h-bar components plus half eta times the h scalar so this is a bit messy but we can sub in this new formula for the h components into our formula for the einstein tensor and we get one half times this set of six terms we're going to show that these four terms with the h bars stick around but all the other terms cancel out with each other if we look at the alpha mu derivatives acting on this term this eta metric can lower the alpha derivative to a new derivative and looking at the alpha new derivatives acting on this term we can lower this alpha derivative to a mu derivative these negative derivatives acting on this term we can leave as is and for this term we can use the alpha beta metric to lower this beta index to an alpha so these two mu new derivatives with the one half cancel with this negative mu new derivative and these two negative one-half alpha alpha derivative terms cancel with this positive alpha alpha derivative term so only the four h-bar terms remain so applying this definition of h-bar to the six terms in the einstein tensor we can simplify the einstein tensor to four terms with h-bar so for linearized gravity the metric g is the minkowski metric eta plus a small change h where the derivatives of h are small the inverse metric g is the inverse eta minus h with raised indices we also have formulas for the connection coefficients the riemann tensor the richie tensor the richie scalar and using this definition for the h-bar components we have this formula for the einstein tensor we can now write the einstein field equations for linearized gravity in the next videos we'll discuss how to pick a coordinate system in linearized gravity that make the existence of gravitational waves more obvious where we can plainly see the metric tensor obeys the wave equation
