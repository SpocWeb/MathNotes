in the relativity 109 videos we're going to discuss gravitational waves in this video we're going to give an introduction to the idea of gravitational waves including the ligo detectors and the wave equation then in future videos we're going to derive the existence of gravitational waves using linearized gravity the lorentz gauge and the transverse traceless gauge which shows us the plus and cross polarizations of gravitational waves finally we'll talk about how gravitational waves interact with free particles so the idea behind the next few videos is we're going to start with the main equations of general relativity which are the einstein field equations and show how they naturally lead to an equation for gravitational waves which travel at the speed of light c we'll start with a review of waves informally a wave is a disturbance that propagates in a medium for example a wave can travel along a string or the surface of a body of water sound is a wave that propagates through the air and light is a wave in the electromagnetic field we're going to see that a gravitational wave is a disturbance in the space-time metric that propagates through space-time this basically means that space itself will stretch and compress as the wave propagates through a given region of space-time in any given medium waves are usually caused by some sort of wobble a string wave is caused by plucking the string a water wave can be caused by tossing a rock into the water and making a splash a sound wave can be made by hitting a drum and making the drum head wobble back and forth and an electromagnetic wave can be created with an antenna which basically makes electric charges wobble back and forth to put things more mathematically a wobble basically means an acceleration so an acceleration in the string water air pressure or electromagnetic field will create a wave loosely speaking gravitational waves are caused by wobbles of mass energy or momentum described by the energy momentum tensor the most straightforward way for a gravitational wave to be produced is to have two massive bodies orbiting each other which is basically like two masses wobbling back and forth the sun earth gravitational system does technically emit gravitational waves but these are extremely extremely weak and basically not detectable in fact even the strongest gravitational waves are very difficult to detect as we'll see later most of the gravitational waves that we can actually detect come from binary gravitational systems involving extremely dense masses called compact stars like white dwarfs and neutron stars or black holes as an example if we have two black holes orbiting each other this will create gravitational waves also called gravitational radiation as seen in this animation by nasa i'm not going to get into all the mathematical details but when a binary system releases gravitational radiation this causes the orbit to decay and causes the two bodies to spiral towards each other during the in spiral the velocity of the objects also increases causing them to spiral faster and release even more gravitational radiation right before the bodies collide or merge they will release a very large burst of gravitational radiation the waveform of the gravitational radiation looks something like this growing larger and larger over time as the orbit decays before releasing a large burst right before the merge and then reducing to zero the derivation of this in spiral behavior are in some notes i'm including linked in the description these relatively large bursts of gravitational waves are actually still very weak changes in the space-time metric but they can be detected by modern detectors such as the ligo before talking about ligo here's a brief history of gravitational waves in 1915 einstein published field equations for general relativity in 1916 einstein published another paper that predicts the existence of gravitational waves as i said before the predicted waves would be very weak even in the case of large gravitational events so detecting them experimentally would be very difficult in the 1970s and 80s the hulse taylor binary star system which is a neutron star and a pulsar orbiting each other were observed to experience a decay in their orbit this orbit decay matched up with the expected orbit decay due to gravitational radiation and gave indirect evidence of gravitational waves then on september 14 2015 direct detection of gravitational waves was accomplished by the ligo detectors and the results were reported publicly in 2016. the ligo detectors are a pair of gravitational wave detectors in the united states in livingston louisiana and hanford washington so how do the ligo detectors work well ligo stands for laser interferometer gravitational wave observatory so ligo detectors are basically enormous laser interferometers an interferometer is a device that measures interference between light beams the basic idea behind an interferometer is that we aim a light source at a beam splitter which splits the beam in two part of it is reflected and part of it passes right through each of the two beams are then reflected by mirrors back towards the beam splitter combine back together and are observed at a detector if the two light beams travel the exact same distance then the two light beam waves will recombine perfectly and the detector will see a single blob of light however if the two paths have slightly different lengths then the two light beams will be slightly out of phase leading to an interference pattern on the detector due to the constructive and destructive interference of the two waves the michelson morley experiment from 1887 used an interferometer to try and detect the existence of the ether an absolutely stationary reference frame that light traveled in the hope was that since the earth was moving through the stationary ether this would increase the path length for one of the split beams but not the other causing an interference pattern but as we know the michelson-morley experiment did not detect any significant differences in the path lengths for light which was good evidence for the need for special relativity the ligo detectors are interferometers that use the exact same principle of interfering light beams except each arm of the interferometer is four kilometers long and they are set up so that the default result of the light beams is destructive interference with any additional changes in the path lengths causing constructive interference causing the detector to receive light the idea is that since gravitational waves squash and stretch space itself a gravitational wave passing through the earth will slightly increase the physical length of one arm of the interferometer and slightly decrease the physical length of the other arm which will lead to a change in the path lengths for each of the split beams this causes phase alignment for the light beams when they are recombined causing light to reach the detector now these interferometers are very sensitive and could be affected by environmental effects like earthquakes and lightning storms so a lot of care needs to be taken to isolate the detector equipment from its environment for example the arms of the interferometer are brought to a near perfect vacuum to reduce sound vibrations and light scattering the mirrors are also suspended from threads so that they are less susceptible to shaking from the surrounding environment also the reason that there are two ligo detectors on opposite sides of the united states is that a true gravitational wave would affect both of them at basically the same time so if one of the detectors sees a signal but the other one doesn't that's an indication that the signal is likely due to some disturbance that's local to that point on earth and not a true gravitational wave the ligo detectors detected their first gravitational wave in 2015 which was then reported publicly in 2016 and since then they have detected over 50 gravitational wave events to understand the mathematics of gravitational waves i'm going to start with the review of the wave equation if a measures the wave's amplitude at a given time and location the wave equation basically says that the second derivative of the amplitude in space is proportional to the second derivative of the amplitude in time the constant of proportionality is v squared where v is the velocity of the wave the simplest solution to the wave equation are plane waves which are basically a cosine function multiplied by an amplitude the cosine function input contains time multiplied by angular frequency omega plus or minus the position multiplied by the angular wave number kx the plus or minus sign indicates waves that travel in the minus x direction or plus x direction respectively the second derivative of the solution with respect to time gives the original wave multiplied by the angular frequency squared and the second derivative with respect to x gives multiplication by the angular wave number squared plugging these into the original wave equation we get that the wave velocity equals the frequency over the wave number a plane wave on a space-time diagram looks like this this wave is traveling to the left as time goes on if we look at a slice of constant time the wave looks like this and if we look at a slice of constant position the wave looks like this the x-wave at constant t is more sharply curved so the wave's partial second derivative in the x direction is bigger the t wave at constant x is less curved so the wave's partial second derivative in the t direction is lower so knowing the x direction is more curved and the time direction is less curved the wave equation tells us that the wave speed must be pretty small so the wave speed can be determined by how sharply curved the wave looks in the x and t directions we can get the wave equation in 3d by generalizing the 1d wave equation we divide by v squared to move it to the other side and replace the x derivative with a sum of the derivatives for x y and z this can also be written as the divergence of the gradient of a which is also called the laplacian of a the wave equation describes waves on a string in water and sound waves the wave equation also describes electric and magnetic waves which come from maxwell's equations if we consider the case of electric and magnetic fields in a vacuum this means that the charge density rho is zero and the current density j is also zero as i showed in relativity 103e this allows us to combine the four maxwell's equations into two wave equations for electric and magnetic waves which both travel at the speed of light c the equation for electric waves can be written in several different ways this is the standard notation but we can also insert the speed of light c into the time derivative variable since c is a constant this looks closer to how we write equations in special and general relativity where we use c times t as our time coordinate we can also rewrite c t x y z as x 0 x 1 x 2 and x 3. this other notation uses a subscript to indicate which space-time variable we're taking partial derivatives with respect to now this combination of plus minus minus minus should look familiar if you've studied special relativity these are the coefficients of the minkowski metric for flat spacetime whose metric is represented by the greek letter eta this is technically the inverse minkowski metric because its mu and new indices are raised so that we can sum them with the lowered indices of the partial derivatives we can also use this inverse metric to raise the index of this partial derivative so a partial derivative operator with a raised index is just a shorthand for an ordinary partial derivative with a lowered index but summed with the inverse metric finally we can also write this combination of derivative operators as a single square symbol called the dalembere operator or dalaim version the dalan bear operator represents this combination of derivatives and metric in a way that doesn't depend on the coordinate system since any change to the coordinates we'll change the partial derivatives covariantly and change the inverse metric twice contravariantly so that the end result doesn't depend on the coordinates if you're familiar with the laplacian operator for 3d space which is a triangle you can kind of think of the three sides of the triangle representing the three dimensions of space and you can kind of think of the four sides of the square dilembar operator as representing the four dimensions of space time we get gravitational waves when we apply the wave equation to the metric tensor we can write this gravitational wave equation using any of the previous notations that we covered but they all mean the same thing a gravitational wave is a disturbance in the metric that propagates through space-time gravitational waves cause space itself to stretch and compress so that objects move closer and farther apart from each other as the wave passes by we'll prove that the space time metric obeys the wave equations over the course of the next few videos
