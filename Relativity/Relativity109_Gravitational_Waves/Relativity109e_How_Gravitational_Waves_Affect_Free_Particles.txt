in this video we're going to see how gravitational waves affect free particles so we're finally going to see how gravitational waves which are ripples in the curvature of space-time cause the distances between free particles to expand and contract as the wave passes by just to review what we've covered so far we started with the assumption of weak or linearized gravity where the metric g is equal to the flat metric eta plus a small change h and defining h-bar like this we rewrote the einstein field equations in linearized gravity like this then we introduced the lorenz gauge which is a family of coordinate systems that meet the condition where this derivative of h-bar is zero in the lorentz gauge the first three terms on the left side of the einstein field equations go to zero and if we take the case of a vacuum where the energy momentum tensor is zero the einstein field equations reduce to a wave equation for h-bar so gravitational waves are small deviations away from flat space-time that travel at the speed of light c then we introduced the transverse traceless gauge coordinate system where there are only two independent components of the metric perturbation h bar which are the plus and cross polarizations of gravitational waves in this coordinate system h and h bar are equal since their trace goes to zero so now it's finally time to see how these plus and cross polarized gravitational waves affect free particles as they pass by but there's one issue i want to bring up first we found that in linearized gravity the h-bar components satisfy the wave equation in the vacuum and in the transverse traceless gauge this reduces to the ordinary h components satisfying the wave equation but we know that in relativity coordinate systems are arbitrary and don't play any role impacting physics so it's worth asking what if this wave equation is just the result of wavy lines in the coordinate system and not about real physical waves at all with real gravitational waves we'd expect the world lines of two nearby free particles to wave back and forth as space stretches and compresses due to the gravitational wave but it could be possible that this wave equation actually just describes wavy lines in the coordinate system we can tell the difference between real gravitational waves and wavy coordinates recall that geodesic world lines described by this equation here are the paths that free particles take through space-time when no forces are acting on them the shape of geodesics is only affected by gravity which is the curvature of space-time itself not a four-force vector that's pulling on the particle and geodesics don't depend on coordinate systems also recall that the proper length l naught measures the distance between two space-like separated points at some constant time by integrating tangent vectors over the curve between the two points and the proper length quantity also doesn't depend on coordinates the final result is the same no matter which coordinate system we use so using geodesics which are the coordinate independent paths of free particles and proper distance which is a coordinate independent way of measuring lengths in space we can measure how gravitational waves stretch and compress space in a coordinate independent way so let's start by calculating geodesics of free particles experiencing gravitational waves we're going to focus on massive particles so we can use the proper time tau as our path parameter along geodesic curves also since the four velocity vector u of a particle can be written as the particle's tangent vector d by d tau we can rewrite the derivatives dx by d tau as the u components of the four velocity to make the geodesic equation look simpler what we need now is to calculate the connection coefficients if you recall from relativity 109b we calculated a formula for the connection coefficients in linearized gravity which uses the inverse flat metric eta here and the derivatives of the h perturbation here as usual geodesic world lines come from the solutions to the geodesic equation now given this formula and knowing that the h components are plane waves in the plus and cross polarizations even though many of these h components are zero there are still lots of connection coefficients to calculate and the geodesic equation can get pretty complicated but there's one set of solutions to the geodesic equation that's easy to verify let's look at world lines whose four velocity vectors point completely in the direction of the time coordinate so for the four velocity the time component is c and the spatial components are all zero this is basically a world line that's at rest with respect to the coordinates in space in the sense that the spatial coordinates are constant and it's just moving through time so for these two summations over mu and nu only the terms with time indices survive and since u t equals c this becomes c squared so we can take our geodesic equation divide by c and move the connection coefficients to the other side and using our formula for the connection coefficients we see that all these h terms have at least one t index and we know in our transverse trace list gauge all the h components involving t go to zero so everything on the right hand side goes to zero also this derivative of the u components also goes to zero since all the u components are constant and their derivative must be zero so we get that zero equals zero which means that our original guess of a world line with constant spatial coordinates is a valid geodesic so we know this four velocity vector describes geodesics and since the u components are just the derivatives of the four space-time components we can take the anti-derivative to get the full world line formula which gives the space-time components parameterized as a function of the proper time tau for the particle traveling along the world line this geodesic is basically a starting point b that remains at constant space coordinates and travels forward in the time direction at a rate of c at first glance it might seem like these geodesics imply no waves in space time are happening because the geodesics have constant space coordinates but remember in relativity we can never trust our eyes to measure distances on space-time diagrams it could very well be the case that the proper distance between these two geodesics is changing it turns out this is exactly what's happening here's another way of visualizing the exact same situation in the transverse traceless gauge the spatial coordinate lines are sort of waving along with space-time as the gravitational wave passes by and the distance between neighboring geodesics is actually changing and we can check this by calculating the proper distance l naught between two neighboring geodesics if you recall from the last video on the transverse traceless gauge we derived gravitational plane waves that were traveling completely in the z direction described by this wave vector the resulting two wave amplitudes a plus and a cross only impact the metric in the x and y directions so to understand these gravitational waves let's look at a space-time diagram for how the x-y plane changes over time we'll start with a geodesic at the origin remember our geodesics have constant position coordinates so this geodesic remains on the time coordinate curve attached to the origin for all time next let's take a nearby point given by this displacement vector v we can also look at the geodesic at this point which also has constant position coordinates we can then ask how the proper length l naught of this vector changes over time the technically correct way to approach this question is to treat the vector v as a curve parameterized by a path parameter lambda then get the curve's length by integrating over the curve's tangent vectors d by d lambda the magnitude of d by d lambda is given by the square root of negative d by d lambda dotted with itself where we use a negative sign because this is a space like curve our curve can just go from lambda equals zero to lambda equals one with the x and y coordinates being proportional to the x and y components of the vector v if we churn through the math the result ends up just being the magnitude of the vector v with no integral required so all we need to do to get the proper distance between these two geodesics is to calculate the dot product of v with itself so we can expand the vector v as a linear combination of basis vectors and the dot product of the basis vectors becomes the metric tensor components g normally this sum would be over all four space-time components but since we know the displacement vector is only in the x-y plane will only sum over x and y and since we know the metric tensor is symmetric g x y and g y x are the same so we can combine these into two times the same term now remember for each of these three terms the g metric is the flat metric eta plus the metric perturbation h given here now in our flat metric sign convention the xx and yy components of the flat minkowski metric are negative one and the off-diagonal elements like x y are zero the h terms come from our plane waves multiplied by the amplitude matrix with the amplitudes of the plus and cross polarizations h x x gives us the a plus amplitude h x y gives us the a cross amplitude and h y y gives us the negative a plus amplitude and all of these are multiplied by plane waves so looking at all these terms we can group them into the two constant terms and the three perturbation terms that are multiplied by the plane wave we can also group the two a plus terms together by factoring out a plus so the first part of this result for measuring the squared length of the vector is the standard result from the flat minkowski metric and it has a negative sign because the displacement vector v is a space-like vector the rest of the terms are the changes in the metric due to gravitational waves so we can see here that the distance between the two neighboring geodesics is in fact changing due to vibrations in the h part of the metric even though the geodesics have constant space coordinates in the transverse traceless gauge to understand the effect of these waves i'm going to look at the changes in geometry due to this second part of the metric involving plane waves which i'll call delta for short let's see how the metric changes when the two geodesics are separated by a displacement vector in the x direction so all the v y components in our formula go to zero we're left with a plane wave multiplied by the a plus polarization amplitude what about if the displacement vector is in the y direction we set the v x components to zero and get the same wave with the a plus polarization amplitude but with a negative sign in front since we can rewrite negative one as e to the i times pi this is the same a plus wave as above but shifted by half a cycle so the vibrations in the x and y directions happen together but they are out of phase by half a cycle now what if the displacement is in a diagonal direction where the v x and v y components are either both positive or both negative for a perfectly diagonal direction the magnitudes of v x and v y are the same so v x squared minus v y squared goes to zero and since v x and v y have the same sign the sign of their product is always positive and our result only contains the a cross amplitude not the a plus amplitude now what if we have a diagonal direction where v x and v y have opposite sign again v x and v y have the same magnitude so v x squared minus v y squared goes to 0. but now since v x and v y have opposite sign the result of their product is negative which again means we get the same a cross wave as above but shifted by half a cycle so note that if the displacement is only in the x or y direction only the a plus part of the wave impacts the proper distance and the a cross part of the wave plays no role in the spatial distance at all and since the x and y directions have wave amplitudes that are out of phase by half a cycle when the x direction has its distance increased by the metric the y direction has its distance decreased by the metric and the reverse is true half of a wave cycle later where x decreases and y increases and if our displacement is in a diagonal direction then only the a cross part of the wave impacts the proper distance and the a plus part of the wave plays no role in the distance and the two perpendicular diagonal directions have opposite phase so that when one direction has its distance increased by the metric the perpendicular direction's distance is decreased and again half a cycle later the perpendicular directions swap so that when one decreases the other increases so i've showed these animations of plus and cross polarized gravitational waves before and while the spirit of this animation is true these animations are geometrically inaccurate a plus polarized wave will leave the diagonal points on a circle completely unchanged because for a diagonal displacement only the a cross part of the wave influences it and conversely a cross polarized wave will leave the horizontal and vertical points on a circle completely unchanged because for the horizontal and vertical directions the points are only impacted by the a plus part of the wave not the a cross part of the wave remember in order to get the actual distances between points in a gravitational wave we calculate the square root of this negative dot product so the terms under the square root should include the flat minkowski result as well as the terms associated with the plus and cross polarized gravitational waves so now we finally understand the mathematics behind the ligo detector if a gravitational wave passes through the earth it will alternate between extending one arm of the detector and shortening the other and then vice versa this causes a difference in the path lengths for light beams that travel along each arm allowing the light beams to interfere with each other in such a way that they send a signal to the detector so to summarize this video we showed that gravitational plane waves cause actual stretching and squashing of physical space through a time-varying wave in the components of the metric perturbation h we showed this by calculating the proper length between neighboring geodesics and showing it changed over time and space in linearized gravity gravitational plane waves have two polarizations the plus polarization maximally affects the x and y directions and does not impact diagonal directions and the cross polarization maximally affects diagonal directions and doesn't impact the x and y directions if you want more proof that gravitational waves are indeed changes in the curvature of space time you can calculate the riemann curvature tensor for a vacuum space time experiencing a gravitational wave and show that the riemann curvature tensor is non-zero i've included links in the description if you want to go through the calculations
