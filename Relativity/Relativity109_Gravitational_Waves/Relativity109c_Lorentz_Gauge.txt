in this video we're going to finish deriving the existence of gravitational waves using a special coordinate system called the lorenz gage we're continuing on from the last video where we wrote the einstein field equations using linearized gravity where the metric g equals the flat metric eta plus a small perturbation h where we used this definition for h with a bar on top the reason we care about linearized gravity is that gravitational waves can be formulated as vibrations in the metric which are small deviations away from flat space time the small changes away from flat space time are given by the h term in the metric so given this equation for the einstein tensor capital g in linearized gravity it's possible to do a change of coordinates where all these terms go to zero except for the last one which is the dilem version of the bard h this fact basically shows that the metric obeys a wave equation in the vacuum where all the components of the energy momentum tensor are zero so under linearized gravity in this coordinate system the einstein tensor becomes the dilem version of the bard h and in the vacuum the energy momentum tensor goes to zero so the einstein field equations become a wave equation for the metric perturbation h-bar the coordinate system where this happens is called the lorenz gauge and it greatly simplifies the linearized einstein field equations i'll take some time at the end of the video to explain what the term gauge means but for now you can just think of a gauge as meaning a choice of coordinate system so in this video we're going to prove that the lorentz gauge exists and provide a recipe for changing from any coordinate system to the lorentz gauge coordinate system and this shows that the einstein field equations predict that gravitational waves can exist in a vacuum so we need to prove that there's a coordinate system where these first three terms go to zero it turns out that if we can find a coordinate system where the partial beta of h-bar alpha beta with upper indices equals zero these first three terms go to zero for free remember that raising and lowering indices is done with the metric so we can feel free to take a term with raised indices take out the inverse metric and apply the inverse metric to the lowered indices of another term instead so basically we can feel free to take two indices being summed and swap their up and down positions if we want let's start with the third term we can lower the alpha and beta on the derivatives in exchange for raising the alpha and beta on the h-bar term then looking at this inner derivative this is exactly the expression we have for the lorentz gauge condition so if we assume the lorentz gauge condition is true this goes to zero meaning the entire third term goes to 0. for this first term we can lower the alpha on the derivative in exchange for raising the alpha on h-bar we can also raise the new index to a beta if we add a beta new metric with lower indices to the expression this is basically the reverse of lowering an index instead of lowering the beta index and eliminating the metric we're raising the new index and including the metric next since the order of partial derivatives doesn't matter and the eta metric is constant we can move the alpha derivative through so it's sitting next to the h-bar term and since we're always free to relabel indices in a summation as long as we relabel them consistently we can relabel alpha as beta and relabel beta as alpha finally since metric components are symmetric we can switch the alpha and beta indices of the h-bar once again inside the brackets we have the term from the lorentz gauge condition if we assume the lorentz gauge condition is true this goes to zero and the entire term goes to zero the second term looks almost exactly like the first term except some of the indices are relabeled and we can use the exact same procedure to show that the lorentz condition causes this term to go to zero as well so we've shown that if the lorentz condition is true and this derivative of h bar with raised indices is zero the first three terms in this expression for the einstein tensor all go to zero so this condition greatly simplifies the einstein field equations now it's our job to prove that there is a coordinate system with this condition that actually exists and this will be the lorenz gage coordinate system so how do we find a coordinate system where this derivative of h bar is zero this will involve a coordinate transformation from our old coordinates c t x y z to some new coordinates c t tilde x tilde y tilde z tilde to summarize this i can also write the transformation as being from x superscript alpha to x tilde superscript alpha where the alpha index ranges from 0 to 3. one basic type of coordinate transformation we can use is a displacement field which means we take all the x alpha coordinates and move them by some small amount psi alpha to get the x tilde alpha coordinates where the psi denotes the displacement and is different at each space time point this means that we take our old coordinates then displace each coordinate by some small amount and get the new coordinate system for r space time now we're going to assume these psi displacements are small so the coordinates never move too far away from their original position we're also going to assume the derivatives of psi are small so that there are no drastic changes in the displacement so to get x tilde we just take x and add psi and to do the coordinate transformation in the reverse direction to get x we just take x tilde and subtract psi if we take this first equation and differentiate both sides by x beta since x alpha and x beta are independent coordinate directions this partial derivative is always zero unless alpha and beta are the same index in which case this goes to one so we can rewrite this as an alpha beta chronicle delta we can also take the reverse transformation and differentiate by x tilde beta setting this to a chronicle delta as well and we can use multi-variable chain rule to expand this derivative as a summation over x coordinates so our formula for partial x alpha by partial x tilde beta can be written like this with the multivariable chain rule expansion or like this without the multivariable chain rule expansion if we change these alpha indices to sigma's we can plug this in here and distribute since we said that the rate of change of psi is small the product of the two psi derivatives is extremely small and can be ignored and we can use the chronic delta cancellation rule to change this sigma to a beta so this is our formula for partial x by partial x tilde since our aim is to get a metric that satisfies the lorentz gauge condition we're going to want to see how the metric tensor components transform under this change of coordinates so the g tilde metric components are just the dot products of the e tilde basis vectors which are just the partial derivatives with respect to the x tilde coordinates we can expand these x tilde derivatives in terms of x derivatives using multi-variable chain rule which gives us the dot products of the x-basis vectors which just gives us the components of the metric in our original coordinate system we already obtained a formula for partial x over partial x tilde on the previous slide so we can sub this into these two factors relabeling the indices as needed we can also rewrite the g metric as the flat eta metric plus the h perturbation if we distribute these first two sets of brackets we get four terms again since the derivatives of psi are small the product of psi derivatives is very small so we ignore it i'm also going to rewrite these psi derivatives using comma notation where the derivative with respect to x beta is denoted by a comma beta subscript and the derivative with respect to x alpha is denoted by comma alpha next we distribute these three terms over these two terms to get six terms i've also used the chronicle deltas to relabel some of the muse to alphas and relabel some of the news to betas next since the h components are small and the psi derivatives are small their product is small enough to be ignored finally i'll combine eta and h into g and use these extra metrics to lower the new to an alpha and lower this mu to a beta so this is how the metric transforms when we do a change of coordinates involving a displacement field psi if we take both metrics to be the flat edametric plus a small perturbation h we can cancel the etas and see that the h perturbations transform in the exact same way as g as an aside we can use the change of coordinates formula for the components of h to determine a change of coordinates formula for the components of the riemann curvature tensor in linearized gravity if i rewrite these four terms in a column i can replace all the h tildes with the transformation formulas then i can distribute the partial derivatives and turn them into comma subscripts on the size now we need to be careful with our derivative notation because these derivatives are in the tilde coordinates and these derivatives are in the original coordinates but this turns out not to matter if we expand partial psi by partial x tilde using multivariable chain rule then sub in our formula for partial x by partial x tilde this product of small derivatives goes to zero so because psi derivatives are small partial psi by partial x tilde is the same as partial psi by partial x and the same can be said for derivatives of h since those are small as well since the order of partial derivatives doesn't matter the order of the indices after the commas also don't matter and all the psi terms cancel each other in pairs leaving only the h terms which just gives us the riemann tensor components in the original coordinates so what this means is the riemann tensor components don't change under a change of coordinates from a small displacement field psi so our goal is to change coordinates so that our new value of h-tilde bar satisfies this lorentz condition remember the h-bar is defined as h minus one-half eta times the trace of h this applies in the tilde coordinates as well since it can be hard to read both the tilde and the bar above the h from now on i'm going to make the bar above h bar longer so that it's easier to read so we know how h transforms under a displacement field and we have our definition for h tilde bar where we can write the trace of h tilde using h tilde and an inverse eta we can plug in h tilde from our transformation formula into the h tilde bar definition we can then distribute one half and these etas over these three terms eta inverse summed with the h components gives us the trace of h and we can use these inverse etas to raise the alpha and beta indices on these size we can then write this combination of terms as h-bar and combine these two one-halfs into a single term this formula tells us how our h-bar components transform under a change of coordinates using a displacement field psi and if we sum on both sides with two inverse etas we can get a similar transformation formula for h-bar with raised indices some of these etas can raise mu and new indices and if we take the derivative of all terms in the beta direction because the order of partial derivatives doesn't matter and because the eta metric is symmetric these last two terms are actually equal if we relabel the summation indices in the right way so they cancel out and if we change from comma notation to partial derivative notation this just becomes the square dial inversion operator so if we're in a coordinate system with a given h bar and we choose a displacement field psi that has this property that this partial summed with the raised h-bar components is equal to the dial inversion of psi this would mean that the right hand side of the above equation goes to zero meaning that the new tilde coordinate system satisfies the condition for the lorentz gauge coordinate system so this basically gives us instructions for changing to a coordinate system that meets the lorentz gauge condition we know how h bar transforms under a displacement field psi and if we specifically choose our displacement field psi to satisfy this differential equation the new coordinate system we will end up with will meet the lorentz gauge condition now it's important to notice that the choice of displacement field psi for getting the lorentz gauge is not unique for example a second displacement field chi that has the property of having a zero dial inversion can be added to psi and since its style inversion goes to zero this differential equation is still satisfied so the displacement field psi plus chi will also bring us to a lorentz gauge coordinate system so the lorentz gauge is really a class of coordinate systems not just a single coordinate system since there are multiple different coordinate systems that satisfy the lorentz gauge condition and recall in any lorentz gauge coordinate system these first three terms and the formula for the einstein tensor go to zero so we're left with the einstein tensor equaling negative one half of the dial inversion of hbar and if we're in a vacuum where the energy momentum tensor is zero this directly shows us that the metric perturbation h bar is a solution to the wave equation so in lorentz gage coordinates in the vacuum the h-bar components satisfy the wave equation written here using the square dial inversion operator we can also rewrite the dial inversion as second derivatives of our space-time coordinates and rewrite the spatial derivatives as the laplacian operator this gives us the more familiar wave equation from non-relativistic physics therefore the einstein field equations predict the existence of waves that can travel through the curvature of space-time in the form of small perturbations away from the flat metric and we can see here that the gravitational waves travel through space-time at the speed of light c so this implies that the effects of gravity are not instantaneous like in newtonian gravity instead gravity travels at the speed of light c which is basically like the maximum speed of cause and effect in space-time and just to be clear these gravitational waves exist in all coordinate systems coordinate systems are a human invention and they have absolutely no impact on the real physics that actually takes place it's just that the lorentz gauge coordinate system gives us an equation where the existence of gravitational waves becomes very clear and obvious in the next video we're going to look at another coordinate system called the transverse traceless gauge and this will help us see that gravitational waves have two polarizations called the plus and cross polarizations to finish this video i'm also going to take a few minutes to talk about the lorenz gauge in electricity and magnetism and how it relates to the lorentz gauge and general relativity if i make a video on relativistic electricity and magnetism i'll link it in the description but for now i'll just give a quick review loosely speaking a gauge is sort of like a choice that we have the freedom to make and this choice does not result in any changes in our physical system when it comes to electrostatics where no electric charges are moving the electric force on a charge is equal to the charge q times the electric field e at a given point the electric field e can also be expressed as the negative gradient of the electric potential phi this basically means the positive charge will roll down to the lowest potential an important fact is that different potentials can result in the same electric field and the same physics if i take a potential phi and add a constant k to it since the gradient of a constant is zero phi plus k results in the same electric field as phi so the transformation of adding a constant potential leaves the electric field unchanged a magnetic field b can always be expressed as the curl of the magnetic vector potential a again there are multiple vector potentials that can result in the same magnetic field if we have a vector potential a and add the gradient of a function to it this will result in the same magnetic field since the curl of a gradient is zero so the transformation of adding a gradient of a function to the magnetic vector potential leaves the magnetic field unchanged if we upgrade to electrodynamics with moving charges the electric field is now the negative gradient of phi minus the time derivative of a these two equations each give three formulas for the xyz components of the e and b fields now it's possible to take the scalar electric potential and the 3d magnetic vector potential and combine them into a four vector potential curly a this is how we write potentials in special relativity we can also write a for covector potential as a row with the components lowered with the metric we can then rewrite these six equations using the four potential if we include some factors of c you'll notice that each of these six formulas depend on a unique pair of space-time coordinates and we will define these as the components of a rank 2 tensor f called the faraday tensor where the mu new entry equals this formula the faraday tensor units the electric and magnetic fields into a single tensor that is obtained from the four potential curly a just as before different four potentials can result in the same faraday tensor and the same physics if we take a vector potential and add the derivative of a function f the result is the same faraday tensor as the original vector potential there are multiple possible four potentials that will create the same faraday tensor so we have some amount of freedom in picking our four potential this freedom to pick a potential is called a gauge freedom and choosing a specific potential is called choosing a gauge changing from one potential to another in such a way that we don't change the components of the faraday tensor is called a gauge transformation so we have freedom in choosing our potential the specific choice of potential that obeys this formula where the four divergence of the potential is zero is called the lorenz gage the lorentz gage is named after ludwig lorenz who should not be confused with hendrick lorenz after whom the lorenz transform and lorenz force are named after this whole process in electricity and magnetism is analogous to what we talked about in this video in linearized general relativity in e m we have the freedom to pick the four potential a and in linearized gr we have the freedom to choose space-time coordinates and those coordinates come with a specific metric perturbation h in e m multiple different four potentials can give us the same faraday tensor components and in linearized gr multiple metric perturbations can give us the same riemann tensor components in e m a gauge transformation is a change in the four potential that doesn't change the faraday tensor components and looks like this in linearized gr the gauge transformation is a coordinate displacement field that doesn't change the components of the riemann tensor finally in e m the lorentz gauge is a choice of four potential that obeys this zero for divergence condition and in linearized gr the lorentz gage is a choice of coordinates that causes the metric perturbation h to obey this zero four divergence equation so given any choice of coordinates in linearized gravity we always have the ability to choose a displacement field psi which is a gauge transformation to bring us to the lorentz gauge which is a coordinate system that obeys this property and this gauge transformation will not change the components of the riemann tensor and that's all i plan to say about gauges for now
