in the last video we discussed a special class of coordinate systems called the lorenz gauge where the einstein tensor in linearized gravity reduces to a single term involving the dial inversion of the metric perturbation h bar taking the case of a vacuum where the energy momentum tensor is zero the einstein field equations reduce to a wave equation for the metric perturbation which describes gravitational waves in this video we're going to use a special coordinate system called the transverse traceless gauge to show how gravitational waves have two polarizations the plus and cross polarizations the term polarization refers to the geometric orientation of waves for example the electric field in electromagnetic waves can oscillate vertically which is called vertical polarization or oscillate horizontally which is called horizontal polarization these two polarizations combined together in different amounts and different phases can give rise to other polarization types like diagonal polarization or circular polarization now electromagnetic waves are oscillations in the electric and magnetic vector fields so polarization basically just means the direction of the vectors but gravitational waves are oscillations in a metric perturbation and so polarization refers to how the distances between objects change in different directions gravitational waves have plus and cross polarizations which are two different ways that the distances between points can oscillate in linearized gravity all gravitational waves are combinations of the plus and cross polarizations combined together with different amplitudes and phases so we know that in linearized gravity the metric g can be written as the flat metric eta plus a small perturbation h this h perturbation has 16 components so it's worth asking if there are maybe 16 different types of gravitational waves that can propagate through space-time in this video we're going to see that there is a choice of coordinates where the 16 metric components reduce to only two independent components which correspond to the two polarizations of gravitational waves the plus polarization and the cross polarization the coordinate system where these two independent components are most obvious is called the transverse traceless gauge or tt gauge and remember physics doesn't depend on our choice of coordinates there are only two polarizations of gravitational waves regardless of our choice of coordinates but in many coordinate systems this is difficult to see because the components of h have very complicated relationships with each other the tt gauge makes it obvious that there are only two polarizations so we know that in the lorentz gauge coordinate system in a vacuum the einstein field equations tell us that the h-bar components satisfy the wave equation where h-bar is defined here the most straightforward solutions to the wave equation are plane waves where wave peaks come in spatial planes with constant spacing that are infinite in extent while it's true that plane waves are a very specific type of wave since the wave equation is linear any generic wave can be written as a linear combination of plane waves of different frequencies in flat space time a plane wave is written as an amplitude times a cosine we can also rewrite the coefficients with a sum with the minkowski metric or rewrite it as the real part of a complex exponential so in this video i may write plane waves as complex exponentials for convenience but the true gravitational wave is just the real part these k coefficients when written with upper indices are the components of the wave vector and when written with lower indices they are the components of the wave co-vector which we discussed in relativity 106 a when we talked about relativistic doppler shift the xyz components of k are the angular wave numbers and the time component is the angular frequency omega divided by the speed of light c division by c gives the angular frequency the same units as the angular wave numbers and also cancels with this c in the c t time component to give an equivalent plane wave equation given a plane wave on a space time diagram the wave covector k represents a stack of surfaces that line up with the waves wave fronts the components of the covector measure the density of the stack surfaces in the space and time directions the corresponding wave vector k is a vector that points in a direction orthogonal to these surfaces where this is the minkowski or lorentz definition of orthogonal so the direction of the vector is reflected in the diagonal line representing a beam of light when we compare the directions of the co-vector surfaces and the wave vector they are mirror images of each other reflected along a diagonal line that represents a beam of light note that the spatial components of the wave covector have the opposite sign compared to the spatial components of the wave vector this is because the spatial orientation of the wave covector stack is reversed compared to the spatial orientation of the wave vector so the spatial wave covector components with lower indices and the spatial wave vector components with upper indices have opposite sign in flat space time in cartesian coordinates we change between the raised and lowered indices using the eta metric and more generally we raise and lower indices with the generic g metric since gravitational waves are oscillations in the four by four symmetric metric perturbation h the amplitude for gravitational plane waves is also a four by four symmetric matrix where we can swap the two indices and get the same value to review waves a little more let's recall what happens when we take the derivative of a plane wave in the alpha direction since the a amplitudes are constant we take them out of the derivative and since the derivative of an exponential is just itself we leave it alone and just get a chain rule term on the end the complex i is constant and the wave covector k for a plane wave is constant so we just get partial x sigma by partial x alpha this goes to zero unless sigma and alpha are the same index so we get a chronic delta which turns this sigma index into an alpha so taking the derivative of a plane wave just gives us the original plane wave times the complex i times the wave covector component in the direction of the derivative since gravitational waves travel at the speed of light this wave covector k must be a null covector also called a light-like covector meaning its squared magnitude is zero to see this we start with the wave equation on h bar and expand the dallam bear operator so we get two partial derivatives on h bar these each give us a factor of the imaginary i times k i times i gives negative one and the metric can be used to raise one of the indices on k since all of this is equal to zero we're forced to conclude that the squared magnitude of the wave co-vector k must also be zero so the wave co-vector or equivalently the wave vector both have a squared magnitude of zero so they are null or light-like so given this wave equation the amplitude a has 16 components as i said at the start of this video there are really only two independent components so let's see how we can narrow down these 16 components down to two components first since gravitational waves are waves in the metric and the metric is symmetric the a matrix must also be symmetric this means that 6 of these 16 components are redundant so there are really only 10 independent components if we choose to look at plane waves in the lorentz gauge this will further reduce 10 to 6 independent components if we're working in a lorentz gauge coordinate system this lorentz gauge condition must be true this beta derivative acting on the plane wave gives a factor of i times k out in front and this forces us to take k summed with the amplitude a to b 0. basically this means that the columns of the amplitude matrix a must be orthogonal to the row of wave covector components k if we use the metric to raise and lower indices we can get an equivalent formula with the wave vector k with upper indices and the amplitude matrix a with lowered indices this constraint of a summed with k giving 0 gives 4 constraint equations on the components of a which reduces a from 10 to 6 independent components now recall the lorentz gauge is not one unique coordinate system it's really a class of coordinate systems if we take some coordinate system in the lorentz gage then apply some displacement field chi where chi satisfies the wave equation the resulting new coordinate system will also be in the lorentz gauge so we have the freedom to pick one specific lorentz gauge coordinate system from all of the lorenz gage coordinate systems we can use this freedom to reduce the number of independent a components from six down to two in particular we will use one particular lorentz gauge coordinate system called the transverse traceless gauge where the two polarizations of gravitational waves become very obvious since we can invent a four component displacement field chi that keeps us inside the lorentz gauge we have four degrees of freedom that we can specify without leaving the lorentz gauge family of coordinate systems since the displacement field ultimately determines the metric perturbation h bar this means we also have four extra degrees of freedom on hbar or equivalently the wave amplitude a so we can define four more constraints on the wave amplitude a three of these will be transverse constraints and one of them will be the traceless constraint let's start with the three transverse constraints let's take a space-time observer with a four-velocity vector u who is experiencing gravitational waves in theory the gravitational wave could be passing by our observer at any angle but since we have four degrees of freedom we have the freedom to choose coordinates where the waves oscillations are at right angles to the observer's world line with right angles also being called orthogonal or transverse mathematically we express this by saying the summation of the wave amplitude a with the observers for velocity u is zero expressed in matrix form here now you might look at this formula and think that there are four constraints here since there are four equations but there are actually only three new constraints here this equation with the wave vector on its own gives four constraints and this equation with the four velocity on its own gives four constraints but together they have one shared constraint so between the two equations there are seven total constraints not eight to see why imagine picking a four velocity vector where only the time component is non-zero this results in all the a components with a t in the second index going to zero which also causes the a components with a t in the first index to go to zero as well since a is symmetric because of this the wave vector constraint now only gives us three meaningful equations since the time equation is already satisfied for free because any a component with a time index already equals zero so this equation now only gives us three new constraints instead of four and the reverse is true as well if we start with the wave vector equation and get four constraints then the four velocity equation will only give us three new constraints so in the lorentz gauge the transverse condition which requires that gravitational wave oscillations be orthogonal to a four velocity vector only gives us three new constraints the last constraint is the traceless constraint which means we take the amplitude matrix a to be traceless remember this involves summing an upper index of a with a lower index of a where one of the indices is raised with the inverse metric so starting in any lorentz gauge coordinate system we pick out a specific lorenz gauge coordinate system called the transverse traceless gauge by defining four constraints on the wave amplitude a three of these constraints come from requiring that the wave oscillations are transverse to an observer with a four velocity u and the fourth constraint demands that a be traceless and since the wave amplitude a sits in front of the plane wave formula we can also rewrite these constraints with hbar instead so these conditions define a specific lorenz gauge coordinate system called the transverse traceless gauge and these four constraints reduce the total degrees of freedom on our wave amplitude down to two now recall that the formula for the h-bar components involves the trace of h if we sum all terms in the equation with the inverse metric this will raise indices on h-bar and h and also cancel with this metric to give us a chronic delta this becomes the trace of h bar this becomes the trace of h and the trace of the chronicle delta in four-dimensional space-time is just the trace of the four by four identity matrix which is four simplifying this equation we get that the trace of h bar equals the negative trace of h now we know that in the transverse traceless gauge the trace of h bar is equal to zero by definition and by the formula we just proved above this also means the trace of h is zero and if we set the trace of h to zero in our original formula this shows us that in the transverse traceless gauge h-bar and h are the same thing so in the transverse traceless gauge any time we've written hbar we can just replace it with h which is just the original metric perturbation without any modification so let's review the constraints on the components of the gravitational wave amplitude a first it must be symmetric also if we use the lorentz gauge it must satisfy this set of four equations with the wave vector k also in the transverse traceless gauge it must satisfy this set of equations with a four velocity vector u and also be traceless to take advantage of these constraints we actually need to pick a four velocity vector u and a wave vector k we'll take the four velocity vector to just be the time basis vector e t multiplied by the speed of light c since the four velocity vector always has a magnitude of c so the time component is c and all the spatial components are zero for the wave vector k we'll take a wave propagating only in the z direction so its wave numbers in the x and y directions are zero and its frequency and time and its wave number in the z direction are equal to each other as required for a null covector with a zero squared length so right away from the constraint involving the four velocity since all the components of the four velocity are zero except the time component all terms in this summation go to zero except for the term involving the time component of the four velocity which is the speed of light c this forces all of the a components with t and the first index to be zero and by the symmetry of a all components of a with t in the second index are also zero so all components of a containing a t time index are zero next using the constraint with the wave vector we get this summation where the x and y components of the vector are zero we already showed that a components involving a t index are r0 so this constraint results in a components with the first index of z going to zero and by symmetry of a all components involving a z index go to zero next since the trace of a is zero this tells us that a x x and a y y are really the same component but with opposite sign so they are not independent and finally the off-diagonal x y and y x components are equal to each other by the symmetry of a so they are not independent either so after looking at symmetry and all the redundancies available in our choice of coordinate system the wave amplitude matrix a has two independent components a x x and a x y and we're going to rename these as a plus and a cross as you can probably guess these two numbers correspond to the amplitudes of the plus polarization and the cross polarization that are present in a given gravitational wave we'll talk about these more in the next video but a plus polarized gravitational wave causes a ring of free particles to stretch and compress along the directions of a plus sign and a cross polarized gravitational wave causes a ring of free particles to stretch and compress along the directions of a multiplication cross sign so to summarize this video if we're looking at gravitational plane waves and the metric perturbation h bar we showed how we can take the 16 components of the metric perturbation and reduce them to only two independent components six of these components are made redundant due to the inherent symmetry of the h matrix and another eight components are redundant because they are a result from our freedom to choose whatever coordinate system we like and space time if we focus on the lorentz gauge class of coordinate systems and further narrow down to the unique transverse traceless gauge coordinate system we see that there are only two independent components of the metric perturbation h which corresponds to the plus and cross polarizations of gravitational waves
