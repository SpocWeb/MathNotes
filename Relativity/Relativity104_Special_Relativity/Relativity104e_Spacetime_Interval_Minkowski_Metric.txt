in this video we're going to look at the minkowski metric tensor and the space-time invariant the space-time invariant which is also called the space-time interval is a way to measure a kind of distance between two events in space-time in special relativity so far in special relativity we've found that different observers disagree on time space and velocity and therefore also momentum and kinetic energy the only quantity that all inertial frames seem to agree on is the speed of light in a vacuum c in this video we're going to introduce a new quantity that all inertial frames agree on which is the space time invariant s squared for a vector which equals c t squared minus x squared the space-time invariant is how we measure distances in space-time this video is going to be all about taking geometry that you're familiar with in everyday life which is euclidean geometry and changing it slightly so that we get minkowski geometry which is the geometry of space time and special relativity instead of measuring distances or length using the familiar equation x squared plus y squared we're going to measure distances in space time using the space-time invariant c t squared minus x squared instead of using the euclidean metric where the dot products of an orthonormal basis are 1 0 1 we're going to use the minkowski metric where the dot products of an orthonormal basis are 1 0 negative 1. instead of using circular trig functions like sine and cosine we're going to use hyperbolic trig functions like hyperbolic sine and hyperbolic cosine and instead of doing circular rotations in 2d space we're going to do hyperbolic rotations in space-time we'll see that lorentz transformations that we've been studying all along are really just hyperbolic rotations first let's talk about the concept of length in euclidean geometry we'll see that the space-time invariant is the equivalent concept in mankowski geometry for special relativity we know that the familiar formula for the length of an object in 2d space is just the pythagoras's theorem formula length squared equals x squared plus y squared we can use this formula to get the length of an object and this formula is nice because it works in any orthonormal basis so as long as our basis vectors have length 1 and are perpendicular to each other this formula will work and give us the length of an object here's an example let's say that this pencil is a vector denoted by capital r in the e x e y basis this vector equals four e x vectors plus three e y vectors if we take the formula for squared length and plug in four for x and three for y then we get four squared plus three squared which is just sixteen plus nine or twenty five if we use another orthonormal basis given by e x tilde and e y tilde then r equals 5 e x tilde vectors exactly if we plug in 5 and 0 into the squared length formula we get 5 squared plus 0 squared which is also 25. so we get the same answer for the squared length of the pencil in any orthonormal basis now in space time in special relativity we have a similar concept called the space-time invariant s squared which equals c t squared minus x squared notice that we are using a minus sign here instead of a plus sign this minus sign is extremely important the space-time invariant helps us measure a kind of distance between two events in space-time and the result is the same in any orthonormal basis in space-time now in space-time the definition of orthonormal is a bit different than you'd expect and i'll talk about this more later but for now you can think of space-time basis vectors as being orthonormal when they scissor together like this as we've seen with lorentz transformations and this definition of orthonormal is called minkowski orthonormal if this vector capital s connects two events in space time then s equals 5et time vectors and 3 e x position vectors plugging 5 and 3 into the space-time invariant formula we get 5 squared minus 3 squared which is 25 minus 9 or 16. if we use this other space time basis e t tilde and e x tilde s equals four e t tilde vectors exactly plugging in four and zero into the space-time invariant formula we get four squared minus 0 squared which is also 16. so the space-time invariant s-squared is the same in all orthonormal space-time coordinate systems if we use the mankowski definition of orthonormal in special relativity space-time basis vectors that are minkowski orthonormal correspond to inertial reference frames this means that for a given space-time vector the space-time invariant s-squared is the same in all inertial reference frames so we can go ahead and prove that the space-time invariant is the same in all inertial reference frames let's start with the space-time invariant in the ct tilde x-tilde reference frame so s squared is equal to c t tilde squared minus x tilde squared recall that our lorentz transformation to move to another inertial frame with velocity beta looks like this where beta is just a fraction of the speed of light v over c and the gamma coefficient is just one over the square root of one minus beta squared if we plug in this formula for ct tilde and x tilde into the formula for the space-time invariant we get this now if we expand ct minus beta x squared we get four terms ct squared beta times x squared and we get minus ct times beta times x twice so we write that as minus two c t beta x and if we expand minus beta c t plus x squared then we get another four terms beta ct squared x squared and once again we get minus beta ctx twice so we write that as -2 beta ctx so we have one set of brackets with a positive gamma squared in front and another set of brackets with a negative gamma squared in front but notice that 2 ct beta x is the same thing as 2 beta ctx this first one is negative and the second one is negative but also has this other negative sign out in front of the brackets so it's actually positive so the negative and positive terms cancel out with each other and if we pull the gamma squared out of everything and put it in front then we get this now notice that inside these brackets we have ct squared and also negative beta ct squared so we can factor out ct squared from both of those and get ct squared times one minus beta squared and we can also factor out x squared from beta x squared and negative x squared and this gives us negative x squared times one minus beta squared and this negative sign out in front is what lets us change signs in here so that 1 is positive and beta squared is negative so notice that we have 1 minus beta squared in both of these terms so we can factor that out and put it in front next to the gamma squared but remember gamma is just one over the square root of one minus beta squared and if we square gamma we just get the reciprocal of one minus beta squared so these cancel out and just become one and that means that we're left with ct squared minus x squared which is the exact same formula we started with except now it's using the new time and space coordinates so what we've shown is that the space-time invariant s squared is the same in any two coordinate systems that are connected by a lorentz transformation in other words the space-time invariant is the same in all inertial coordinate systems so we've confirmed that the space-time invariant s-squared is agreed on by all inertial reference frames so physical length is a quantity that we agree on in 2d physical space and the space time and variant is a quantity that we agree on in space time however when talking about 2d length we generally only talk about positive lengths but the space-time invariant can actually be positive zero or negative in the case of s squared being positive this must mean that the size of the time coordinate ct squared is greater than the size of the position coordinate x squared if we remember the equations of beams of light x equals c t to the right and minus x equals c t to the left then a vector with a positive s-squared value has a beta value magnitude x over ct that is less than one remember beta is just the fraction of the speed of light v over c and the speed v is just position x over time t so beta is just x over c t this means that it is slower than the speed of light so this means that a vector with a positive s squared value has a slope that is more vertical than a beam of light therefore this vector exists in this shaded region of the space-time diagram which is called the light cone also if we measure this vector in a reference frame where the tip and tail of the vector are at the same position the position coordinate is zero in this case s squared equals c t squared assuming positive time this gives us s equals ct in this special case where the position is zero we also denote the time coordinate by c times tau c times tau describes the time between events in a reference frame where the events happen at the same position this is called the proper time between the two events the proper time tau is the shortest possible time between two events when measured from an inertial reference frame any inertial reference frames that are moving with respect to the events will measure a time that is increased due to time dilation which we discussed in relativity 104 part c c times tau describes the time in distance units like meters and tau on its own describes the time in ordinary time units like seconds remember when measuring time in meters we just measure how long it takes for a light beam to travel that distance here's an example if we calculate s squared for this spacetime vector s that connects these two events then we get positive 16 which is greater than zero this means that s which is equal to c times the proper time tau equals four we can think of c times tau equals four as measuring the proper time in distance units if we wanted to measure the proper time in ordinary time units we would divide both sides by c to get tau equals 4 over c since c times tau is 4 time units this means that the shortest possible time between the events at either end of the space-time vector s according to an inertial reference frame is also four time units this is the time measured in the reference frame that views the events to happen at the same position and it is the shortest possible time because moving reference frames will see the time dilated to be longer for example the original reference frame we used measured a longer time of five time units now in the second case where s squared equals zero this tells us that x squared equals c t squared in other words c t equals plus or minus x these are exactly the two equations of beams of light with positive x being a light beam going to the right and negative x being a light beam going to the left so s squared equals 0 describes a vector that's pointing along the world line of a light beam and that's all there is to say about the s squared equals 0 case finally if s squared is negative this means that ct squared must be less than x squared this means that the beta value has a magnitude x over ct that is greater than 1 meaning it is faster than the speed of light this means that a vector that has a negative s-squared value has a slope that is more horizontal than a beam of light therefore this vector exists outside the light cone in a space-time diagram also if we measure this vector in a reference frame where the tip and the tail are at the same time then the time coordinate will be zero in this case the square root of negative s squared is equal to x assuming positive distance we also denote this by the special symbol l naught which is the length of an object in its own reference frame l naught is called the object's proper length the proper length is the length of an object when measured in its own reference frame and it is the longest possible length that an object has this is because moving reference frames will see the object length contracted and will measure it to have a shorter length if we calculate the s-squared value for this space-time vector s we get negative 16 which is less than zero so if we take the negative of this and take the square root we get the proper length of this vector which is four this means that in the vector's own reference frame we know that its length is exactly four distance units long so in the familiar euclidean geometry of 2d space the length l of an object is agreed upon in all orthonormal frames to be x squared plus y squared but in the minkowski geometry of space time it is the spacetime invariant s squared which equals c t squared minus x squared that is the same in all mankowski orthonormal frames and the space-time invariant can be positive zero or negative also vectors with positive s squared are called time like vectors because their s value represents proper time between two events vectors with s squared equals zero are called light-like vectors because they point along the paths of light they are also called null vectors because their s value is zero vectors with negative s squared are called space-like vectors because their s-values represent proper distance between two events now i've been saying that inertial reference frames are given by minkowski orthonormal basis vectors but what does minkowski orthonormal actually mean to find out let's compare the euclidean metric in euclidean geometry and the minkowski metric in minkowski geometry let's say that in 2d space we have a vector capital r given by x e x plus y e y to get the squared length of this vector we just take the dot product of r with itself if we expand the vector out in the basis and then distribute over the dot product we get four terms these four terms can be rewritten in a matrix equation like this and this matrix of dot products is called the metric tensor matrix i already covered this in relativity 103 part d if we assume we're working in an orthonormal basis then the basis vectors have length 1 and are perpendicular to each other this means that a basis vector dotted with itself equals 1 and a basis vector dotted with any other basis vector equals 0. this means that in an orthonormal basis the metric tensor matrix is the identity matrix and the formula for the squared length of a vector is x squared plus y squared but remember this is only true in an orthonormal basis so in 2d space the metric tensor is called the euclidean metric tensor and in an orthonormal basis the metric tensor matrix is the identity matrix but now we're going to talk about what it means for a basis to be orthonormal in space-time a minkowski orthonormal basis is one where the time basis vector dotted with itself gives positive one but a position vector dotted with itself gives negative one and any mixed basis vector dot products go to zero so in space-time let's say that we have a space-time vector capital s which is c t e t plus x e x to get this vector's minkowski length we do the dot product of s with itself after expanding s in terms of the basis and distributing over the dot product and then writing in matrix form we get this and this matrix is the minkowski metric tensor matrix which helps us measure distances in space-time remember in a minkowski orthonormal basis e t dot et is positive one e x dot e x is negative one and e t dot e x is zero so in a minkowski orthonormal basis the metric tensor matrix has components one zero zero negative one and the formula for the minkowski length of a vector is ct squared minus x squared which is just the space-time invariant so the space-time invariant is just the squared length of a vector when measuring it in a mankowski orthonormal basis in other words it's the length of a vector when measured with the minkowski metric tensor matrix if we were to change basis using the lorentz transformation equations we could calculate the basis vector dot products in the new basis to calculate e t tilde dot e t tilde we just sub in these formulas from the lorentz transformation and then distribute over the dot product e t dot e t goes to plus one e x dot e x goes to minus one and the mixed dot products go to zero this leaves us with gamma squared minus gamma squared times beta squared factoring out gamma squared we get gamma squared times one minus beta squared but knowing the definition of gamma if we square it then we just get the reciprocal one over one minus beta squared so this goes to one we can use a similar approach to calculate that e t tilde dot ex tilde is zero and e x tilde dot e x tilde is negative one so we find that a minkowski orthonormal basis that is transformed by a lorentz transformation stays mankowski orthonormal and that means when we calculate the squared length of a space-time vector which is the space-time invariant we end up using the same minkowski metric tensor matrix so in an orthonormal basis the euclidean metric tensor matrix is the identity matrix one zero zero one but the mankowski-metric tensor matrix for space-time is one zero zero negative one now it is possible to write these metric tensor matrices in a non-orthonormal basis as well in relativity 103d i gave examples of non-orthonormal bases in 2d space whose metric tensor matrices were not the identity matrix because of this the formula for pythagoras's theorem is different in each case similarly we can have non-minkowski orthonormal bases in space-time whose metric tensor matrices are not the matrix 1 0 0 negative 1. and the corresponding formulas for the space-time invariant are different in each case however for the most part in special relativity we're mainly going to focus on minkowski orthonormal bases where the minkowski metric tensor matrix is one zero zero negative one because these correspond to inertial reference frames so in conclusion for any orthonormal basis in 2d space the metric tensor matrix is the identity matrix and we can calculate the squared length of a vector using this matrix equation here and in space time for any minkowski orthonormal basis the minkowski metric tensor matrix has the components one zero zero negative one and we can calculate the squared length of a vector which is the spacetime invariant using this matrix formula one thing i will say is that in previous videos i said vector components are contravariant and that we should always write contravariant things as columns however here i'm writing contravarian vector components as a row which breaks this rule unfortunately if we want to get the right formula for the space-time invariant using these standard rules of matrix multiplication we also have to break this rule and write the contravariant vector components as a row it's technically possible to write the metric tensor as a nested row of rows and this lets us write the vector components as columns as expected but this is a little bit awkward so unfortunately for getting the correct space-time invariant formula we need to break the rules and write the contravariant vector components as a row here we'll talk briefly about trigonometry this topic isn't as important so i'm going to rush through it pretty quickly but it's useful to know a couple things about it you're probably familiar with the trigonometric functions sine and cosine which are used in euclidean geometry these are the circular trig functions we're also going to learn about the hyperbolic trig functions used in minkowski geometry which are the hyperbolic sine also called sine h or cinch and the hyperbolic cosine which is also called cosich or kosh now the equation of a circle is x squared plus y squared equals r squared where r is the radius of the circle and you can see examples of circles with different radii here now we can use circular angles denoted by the greek letter theta to help us find coordinates along a circle various points along a circle of radius r can be obtained by calculating the x coordinate to be r times cos theta and the y coordinate to be r times sine theta in this case we define the angle theta by saying that theta over two is defined to be the area of this circular wedge with a radius of one this matches up with the familiar area of a circle formula pi r squared when we use a full circle angle of two pi radians the x squared plus y squared equals radius squared formula also gives us the fundamental trig identity cosine theta squared plus sine theta squared equals one if we sub in the coordinates for a radius of one we can do something similar for the equation of the space time invariant now the equation ct squared minus x squared equals s squared is not the equation of a circle instead it's the equation of a curve called a hyperbola where s squared is the hyperbolas invariant we can have hyperbolic curves with positive s squared zero s squared or negative s squared here's an example of a hyperbola with positive s squared it has two disconnected portions a top portion for positive c t and a bottom portion for negative c t because this hyperbola has s squared equals positive one this means that every vector whose tip is on the hyperbola curve has a space-time invariant of plus one hyperbolas with larger s-squared values are farther from the origin and hyperbolas with smaller s-squared are closer to the origin note that these curves never cross these diagonal lines with slopes of positive one and negative one these lines that never get crossed are called asymptotes for the case of s squared equals zero we end up with the equations x equals c t and negative x equals c t these are the two equations of diagonal lines with slope one and negative one that were previously the asymptotes for the case of negative s squared we again have two disconnected portions a left portion for negative x and a right portion for positive x we can use hyperbolic angles denoted by the greek letter phi to help us find the coordinates of points on a hyperbola coordinate ct equals s times cosh phi and coordinate x equals s times cinch phi where the area of this hyperbolic wedge is defined as phi over two note that unlike circular angles which loop back on themselves after a rotation of 2 pi radians hyperbolic angles continue increasing towards positive infinity because hyperbolas also increase out toward infinity with the formula ct squared minus x squared equals s squared for an s value of one this gives us the fundamental trig identity cosh phi squared minus sinch phi squared equals 1. so just as circular trig functions can help us get the coordinates of points on circles using the radius the hyperbolic trig functions can help us get the coordinates of points on hyperbolas using that hyperbola's s value now by putting sine and cosine inside of a matrix like this we get a transformation that does a circular rotation on basis vectors a circular rotation of a box just causes the corners of the box to move along a circle this means that a circular rotation keeps the radius of a circle constant we can also invert this matrix just by changing the sign of the angle theta and if we put cinch and kosh inside of a matrix like this this gives us a transformation that does a hyperbolic rotation on basis vectors a hyperbolic rotation of a box just causes the corners of the box to move along hyperbolas this means that a hyperbolic rotation keeps the invariant of a hyperbola constant just as a circular rotation keeps the radius of a circle constant we can also invert this matrix just by changing the sign of the angle phi note that both circular and hyperbolic rotation matrices have a determinant of one this means that when we do either a circular rotation or a hyperbolic rotation of a box the area of the box stays the same a hyperbolic rotation is just squishing the box in one direction and expanding it in the other direction in order to keep the area of the box constant this is what causes basis vectors to scissor together in a hyperbolic rotation now before i said that hyperbolic rotations are just a different name for lorentz transformations it turns out that these two matrices are actually just different versions of the same thing you can pause the video if you want to go through the proof but basically if we define cosh phi to be the gamma coefficient from the lorentz transformation we can prove that the beta coefficient from the lorentz transformation equals cinch phi over coshphi which also happens to be the definition of hyperbolic tangent of phi this means that gamma times beta is just cinch phi knowing this it's not hard to see that a lorentz matrix is really just a hyperbolic rotation written in a slightly different way so lorentz transformations really are just hyperbolic rotations a lorentz transformation will compress space-time coordinates in one diagonal direction and expand the space-time coordinates in the other diagonal direction keeping the area of all boxes in space-time constant this is exactly what a hyperbolic rotation does also it's a lot easier to prove that multiplying two lorentz matrices together gives another lorentz matrix if we multiply the hyperbolic matrix form instead when we combine two lorentz transformations together all we're doing is adding together the hyperbolic angles from each individual lorentz transformation so in galilean relativity in order to combine velocities we just added the velocities together but in special relativity instead of adding the velocities of each reference frame together we add the hyperbolic angles of each reference frame together so to sum up this video in the euclidean geometry of 2d space a circle with a constant radius r has the formula r squared equals x squared plus y squared and in space time a hyperbola with a constant space time invariant s squared has the formula s squared equals c t squared minus x squared in the euclidean metric with an orthonormal basis the metric tensor matrix is just the identity matrix but in a minkowski orthonormal basis where we have ex dot ex equals negative 1 the minkowski metric tensor matrix has this negative sign in the position entry we also learned that the circular trig functions sine and cosine have hyperbolic versions which are cinch and kosh we also learned how to make a circular rotation matrix using sine and cosine which preserves the radius of a circle and a hyperbolic rotation matrix can be made with kosh and cinch which preserves the invariant s squared of a hyperbola and a hyperbolic rotation is just the same thing as a lorenz transformation one last thing i want to bring up in this video i was working with space-time using one dimension of time and one dimension of space obviously there are three dimensions of space x y zed so space time is really four dimensional one dimension of time and three dimensions of space so the full space time invariant formula would look like this and the full minkowski metric tensor matrix looks like this basically in this video i was using the special case where vectors y and z components were both zero however some textbooks will define the space-time invariant with opposite sign where the time coordinate is negative and the space coordinates are positive the minkowski metric tensor matrix also has opposite signs the convention with negative space that i use in this video is called the mostly minuses convention and the convention with negative time is called the mostly pluses convention both of these are popular conventions for the minkowski metric the physics of special relativity works perfectly fine with either one it's just that some formulas and quantities will have a negative sign in one convention but not the other in future videos i'll be using the mostly minuses convention that i used in this video where the dot product of position vectors are negative so if a formula i show has an extra negative sign in it compared to your textbook it's probably because your textbook is using the mostly pluses convention instead
