in this video we're going to talk about relativistic dynamics which is how things like forces energy and momentum behave in special relativity we'll also derive the famous equation e equals mc squared in special relativity we found that different observers disagree on many physical quantities like time space velocity momentum and kinetic energy in previous videos we found that all inertial observers agree on the speed of light in a vacuum c and the space-time interval s squared in this video we're going to introduce the idea of minkowski vectors also called four vectors which are vectors in space-time that all inertial observers agree on in standard newtonian physics we're used to dealing with three-dimensional vectors which in this video i'm going to denote using small lowercase letters we have three-dimensional position small r which measures the x y and z-coordinates of a point and also velocity small u which is the derivative of position with respect to time momentum small p which is mass times velocity acceleration small a which is the second derivative of position with respect to time and force small f which is the derivative of momentum with respect to time which is also mass times acceleration if the mass is constant in special relativity most of these quantities aren't very useful because the time variable is measured differently in different reference frames this means that every frame will take time derivatives with respect to a different time variable recall in the last video that we defined the space-time interval as squared between two events when s squared was positive we said s is equal to the speed of light c times the proper time tau which is the time between two events when they happen at the same position so tau is agreed on in all inertial reference frames since all frames agree on the proper time tau between two events they will also agree on derivatives with respect to tau we can now define minkowski vectors or four vectors which are denoted with big capital letters using derivatives with respect to proper time tau we start with the four position big s which is the four dimensional position in space-time for velocity big u is the derivative of four position with respect to proper time tau for momentum big p is mass times the four velocity for acceleration big a is the second derivative of four position with respect to proper time and four force is the derivative of four momentum with respect to proper time which is also mass times four acceleration if the mass is constant we're going to find that all reference frames agree on these four vectors because they are invariant recall the idea of invariance from relativity 102. if we write the same vector in terms of different basis vectors we get different components we've already seen this idea with the space-time separation vector s which is also called four position and we can change between the components of s in different reference frames using the lorentz transformation in this video we'll see that this is also true for any four vector including four velocity for momentum and others we can write the same geometrical vector with different components in different reference frames and change between the components using lorentz transformations now our starting point for all these minkowski vectors is the four position big s which gives us the position of an event in space time relative to the origin big s has one time component c t and three space components x y z we can get the four velocity big u by taking the derivative of 4 position with respect to proper time tau to calculate this we expand big s into its components since we have the derivative of a sum of terms we can just give the derivative operator to each individual term now normally we would take one of these four derivatives and do product rule with it getting a term with the derivative of the components plus a term with the derivative of the basis vector however in the case of inertial reference frames basis vectors are constant everywhere in space-time so the derivative of a basis vector is zero for inertial frames in future videos when we deal with non-inertial frames we're going to see that these derivatives of the basis vectors are actually non-zero but for this video we're dealing only with inertial frames so the derivative of the basis vectors are zero so the derivative of four position s is another four dimensional vector containing derivatives of t x y and z with respect to proper time tau we can take the speed of light in a vacuum c out in front of the derivative because it's constant let's figure out what dt by d tau is recall the lorentz transformation between a coordinate system c t tilde and x tilde to another coordinate system ct and x here beta is just the fraction of the speed of light u over c and gamma equals one over the square root of one minus beta squared recall that the proper time tau between two events is the time measured between events in a coordinate system where the events happen at the same position let's say in the frame c t tilde and x tilde these two events happen at the same position so x tilde equals 0 between these two events so given the lorentz transformation equation for time this means that if we set x tilde is equal to 0 then the time t tilde is equal to the proper time tau because it's the time between events measured at the same position so this term goes to zero and we can cancel c from both sides to get t equals gamma times tau so taking the derivative of t with respect to tau we just get gamma so we've determined that dt by d tau is gamma and this helps us determine the first component in ds by d tau but what about the xyz derivatives well if we recall chain rule from calculus if we have nested functions where t is a function of tau and f is a function of t we can calculate the derivative of df by d tau by multiplying df by dt and dt by d tau as an example we can consider x of tau instead to be a nested function x of t of tau we can then turn dx by d tau into dx by dt times dt by d tau of course dx by dt is just the familiar velocity in the x direction we know from non-relativistic newtonian physics and i'll denote this velocity by small u with superscript x and we already know from before that dt by d tau is just gamma so the derivative of x with respect to proper time tau is just the ordinary x direction velocity times gamma we can use this chain rule approach for all derivatives of space coordinates with respect to proper time and this gives us the ordinary non-relativistic velocities with respect to the times dt by d tau which is just gamma if we factor out the gamma that appears in every term we see that the four velocity ds by d tau equals gamma times the vector c e t plus u x e x plus u y e y plus u z e z where the lower case u denotes the non-relativistic velocity so the derivative of the four position s with respect to the proper time tau gives us a new four vector called capital u which is the four velocity the components of the four velocity u are given by big u t big u x big e y and big u z remember small or lowercase u denotes non-relativistic velocities with three components x y z with respect to t the big or uppercase u denotes relativistic velocities with four components t xyz with respect to proper time tau we can also write the four velocity in array notation with basis vectors in a row and the vector components in a column if we multiply the arrays we get first entry times first entry second times second third times third and fourth times fourth which gives us the original vector big u so what's so good about this four velocity vector big u the answer is that big u is invariant in all coordinate systems let's see this using an example let's say that einstein is stationary in space in a space-time diagram and a car is moving off to the right in the x-direction at half the speed of light so the non-relativistic velocity in the x-direction ux is one-half c for simplicity let's say that the velocities in the y and z directions are zero so we're only concerned with the x axis and the time axis the square of the total velocity of the car is normally u x squared plus u y squared plus u z squared but since only the x velocity is non-zero this means that the total velocity u is ux which is one-half times the speed of light this means that beta which is u over c is just one half and for beta equals one half the corresponding gamma coefficient is two over the square root of three the four velocity vector of the car has only two non-zero components gamma times c for time and gamma times ux for x direction subbing in 2 over root 3 for gamma and one-half c for ux and canceling these twos we get that big u equals two over root three c e t and one over root three c e x we can see that the components of this four velocity vector match up with the direction of the car's world line in our space-time diagram however in the reference frame of the car the car's 3 velocity is 0 and this means that beta equals 0 and therefore gamma equals 1. in the car's frame the car's 4 velocity equals c times e t tilde all of the space components are 0. again this matches up with the vector big u in our space time diagram so we can see that the four velocity vector big u is an invariant vector it has different components in different reference frames but it is the same unchanging vector in space time also notice that even though the car's ordinary non-relativistic velocity is 0 meters per second in its own reference frame its 4 velocity is not 0. the car still has a non-zero four velocity vector component in the time direction it's just that the spatial components of the four velocity are zero also just as the components of the four position vector can be transformed to different frames of reference using the lorentz transformation the components of the four velocity vector can also be changed to a different frame using a lorentz transformation when we have a four velocity vector written in a basis in array notation with a row of basis vectors and a column of vector components when the basis changes with one lorentz matrix the components change with the inverse lorenz matrix so the components of the four velocity vector big u transform just like the components of the four position vector big s we can see that if we take the lorentz transformation plug the gamma and beta coefficients in and also the ut and ux components in einstein's frame we get the expected four velocity components of u t tilde equals c and u x tilde equals zero for the car's reference frame but these components still describe the same for velocity vector u another thing to notice is that the quantity big u dot big u is also invariant and agreed upon in all reference frames recall that with a minkowski orthonormal basis the time basis vector dotted with itself gives positive one and a position vector dotted with itself gives negative one and mixed basis vector dot products are zero so in our case big u dot big u is u t squared minus u x squared in einstein's frame this gives us 2 over root 3 c squared minus one over root three c squared which is four over three c squared minus one over three c squared which ends up just being c squared in the car's frame we can take this same formula and plug in the four velocity components for the car which are c for time and zero for x this gives us the same result c squared it turns out that big u dot big u is equal to c squared for all four velocity vectors all four velocity vectors have a minkowski length of c the speed of light in a vacuum if you want to go through the proof you can pause this video but the basic idea is to write big u dot big u in terms of a basis then distribute the terms calculate the dot products sub in the formulas for the u components factor out gamma squared and then do some canceling and we get c squared so the minkowski length of all four velocity vectors is c so we've learned that the four velocity vector big u is just the derivative of four position big s with respect to proper time tau and these are its components and its minkowski length will always be c let's take a look at another four vector the four momentum capital p which is defined as the mass times the four velocity vector big u this is similar to the definition in newtonian physics where three momentum equals mass times three velocity small u if we expand the 4 velocity big u we can see the 4 momentum big p written in a basis with components so in some basis e t e x e y e z the components of the four velocity look like this and to get the components of the four momentum we just multiply by the mass m now i should say that any time i refer to the mass m of an object i'm referring to the mass when measured in its own reference frame some textbooks call this the rest mass but i'm just going to call it mass now i will warn you that some textbooks use a definition called relativistic mass which i've written curly m defined as gamma times the rest mass remember since gamma is always greater or equal to 1 this means that the relativistic mass will increase with velocity now the reason that some physicists came up with the idea of relativistic mass is that it makes the components of the four momentum vector look more like the newtonian momentum that we're used to where the spatial components of the four momentum are now just the relativistic mass m times the ordinary three velocity however it's my belief that we should try as much as possible to write relativistic equations using invariant quantities that are the same in all reference frames so in this video series i will not be using relativistic mass since it changes in each reference frame anytime i talk about mass i'm talking about the rest mass of an object that is agreed upon in all reference frames so looking again at the four momentum components the spatial components of the four momentum look pretty familiar they are just the newtonian momentum mass times velocity but multiplied by the gamma factor however the time component of the four momentum gamma times mass times the speed of light looks more mysterious to understand what gamma times m times c is we're going to have to expand gamma as a taylor series in terms of beta recall that the taylor series of a function f x is an infinitely long polynomial in x that approximates f x you might already be familiar with the taylor series of e to the x sine of x and cosine of x it turns out that the taylor series for gamma as a polynomial in beta looks like this if you want to prove this you can calculate the coefficients by taking derivatives of gamma with respect to beta and then evaluating them at beta equals zero now recall beta is just a fraction of the speed of light u over c so we can sub that in now for beta and if we take the time component of four momentum and multiply it by c we get m times c squared times gamma if we expand gamma using the taylor series that we talked about above we get this we can distribute the m c squared to each term in the series let's ignore the first term for now in the second term we see that we can cancel c squared on top with the c squared on the bottom and the higher order terms in the series are not too important for now so we found that we can write c times the time component of four momentum like this the second term in the series is the familiar kinetic energy from newtonian physics one-half times mass times velocity squared this seems to imply that all these higher order terms are new kinetic energy terms that newton didn't know about note that because of the u over c terms in here these terms only become noticeable at speeds close to the speed of light so it makes sense that newton wouldn't have known about them and finally the first term doesn't contain any velocities at all so it must be an energy that all massive objects have even when they are at rest so really we found that c times the time component of four momentum gives us an energy term it's the rest mass energy m c squared plus several additional kinetic energy terms in other words energy divided by the speed of light c gives us the time component of four momentum so we now know the formulas for the four components of the four momentum vector the time component equals energy divided by the speed of light and the space components equal the newtonian three momentum mass times velocity times the gamma factor also since we know that the four velocity dotted with itself gives c squared it isn't hard to calculate the four momentum dotted with itself we just get m big u dotted with m big u which is m squared times big u dot big u which is m squared c squared we also know that we can calculate the dot product of 4 momentum with itself using the minkowski metric where the time component squared gets a positive sign and the spatial components squared get negative signs we already know from above that big p dot big p equals m squared c squared and the time component of the four momentum is energy over c and the position components are just the three momentum components multiplied by gamma now we can multiply all terms by c squared to get this then move this momentum term to the other side of the equation to get this and this is einstein's energy momentum relation it relates the quantities of mass energy and momentum together in a single equation now one special case of this formula is for stationary particles when the non-relativistic momentum mass times velocity is zero in this case the formula reduces to the famous equation e equals m c squared remember this only applies for stationary particles another special case is the case of a massless particle if m equals zero the above formula seems to imply that energy is also zero but we know that light which is massless definitely carries energy since the sun's light heats the earth so something must be wrong here it turns out that the formula mass times four velocity doesn't work to get the four momentum of light the reason is that the four velocity big u is not well defined for light like position vectors the proper time tau for light like position vectors is always zero so it doesn't make sense to take a derivative with respect to tau for a light like position vector and if we try to define the components of a four velocity vector big u for a light like trajectory we end up with u t equals plus or minus u x so we get multiple solutions for what the four velocity components could be so there really is not a good way to define what the four velocity is for light so let's try to come up with a different way to define what the four momentum is for light we know that the four momentum for light should be a null vector with a zero minkowski length and this makes sense because the light's mass is zero this means that the square of the time component of for momentum is equal to the sums of the squares of the position components for the four momentum now we know that the time component of four momentum is equal to energy over c and i'm going to write this combination of the squares of the spatial components of momentum as just big p with the subscript light to indicate the momentum of a light beam so for light which is massless the energy of light comes from its momentum not its mass and if you know some quantum mechanics you'll know that light's momentum is related to its frequency where higher frequencies give higher momentum and energy so we've managed to define the four momentum both for massive objects and massless objects like light let's take a look at how the four momentum vector is invariant by looking at our example with stationary einstein and the moving car we already know the four velocity vector of the car in each of their reference frames so we just multiply that by mass to get the cars for momentum note that in the car's frame the car's four momentum only has the time component and no spatial components the time component is the car's energy since the car doesn't view itself to be moving in its own reference frame its energy is completely in the form of rest mass energy e equals m c squared according to einstein the car is moving we can see that the car does have some momentum in the x direction the time component of the four momentum the energy has also increased because gamma is greater than one for a moving object this means that the car has both rest mass energy and kinetic energy from its motion but in both cases the mass of the car is constant and unchanged even though einstein sees the car with more energy he also sees it with more x momentum which has a negative sign in this formula and the extra energy cancels out with the extra x momentum to leave the mass constant it's the same rest mass that the car would observe in its own reference frame but why do we care about the four momentum one of the reasons for momentum is so important is because four momentum is conserved if you recall newtonian physics the law of conservation of momentum tells us that if we add up all the three momentum vectors of objects before a collision and add up all the three momentum vectors of objects after a collision then the results should be the same for example if two particles with equal momentum in the x and negative x directions collide their total net momentum is zero this means that their total net momentum after the collision must also be zero in special relativity since we found that energy and momentum can mix together when we change reference frames using a lorentz transformation if we want a proper relativistic conservation of momentum law we must use four momentum vectors including both energy and momentum let's look at an example of two objects colliding together from opposite directions on the x-axis after the collision the objects will stick together the first object has four momentum p1 with five energy units and plus three x momentum units moving to the right the second object has four momentum p2 with five energy units and negative three momentum units moving to the left the resulting object after the collision must have for momentum p3 that equals p1 plus p2 this means that p3 has five plus five equals ten energy units and three minus three equals zero x momentum units so the object is stationary in space however the four momentum of the resulting object is not zero overall it still has four momentum in the time component which measures its rest mass energy interestingly if we calculate the mass of each of these objects using the mass energy momentum relation the total mass of the objects before the collision is 4 plus 4 equals 8 mass units but the mass of the particle after the collision is 10 mass units this shows us that in special relativity the rest masses of individual objects is not a conserved quantity before and after collisions we need to remember to look at conservation of four momentum as a whole instead not just conservation of individual rest masses so we've seen that the derivative of four position s with respect to proper time tau gives us the four velocity u it's probably not surprising that if we take the second derivative of 4 position which is the first derivative of 4 velocity we get another vector called the 4 acceleration denoted by capital a now i'm not going to go into a ton of detail with for acceleration because i'm actually going to cover acceleration in special relativity in great detail in the relativity 105 videos so you can watch those videos to learn more but i'll do a quick derivation of the formula for for acceleration and you can pause the video if you want to look at it to take the derivative of the four velocity we use product rule to get two terms one with the derivative of gamma and the other with the derivative of this vector the vector derivative is easy if we use chain rule on the tau derivative to get the t derivatives times gamma the derivative of the first component goes to zero and the rest gives us the non-relativistic acceleration three vector small a multiplied by gamma for the other half of the product rule the derivative of gamma with respect to tau can be changed to d gamma by dt times dt by d tau using chain rule and since this is just the definition of the 4 velocity again the complete formula for for acceleration is d gamma by dt times big u plus gamma squared times little a it can be shown using chain rule that d gamma by dt is gamma cubed times little a dot little u all over c squared with a minus sign in front now the reason that this minus sign is here is because i chose to use the mostly minuses convention for the minkowski metric where a position basis vector dotted with itself gives a negative one because of this the formula ax ux plus a y u y plus a z uz is actually the negative of the little a vector dotted with little u if we had used the mostly pluses convention where a position vector dotted with itself gives positive one then this negative sign would be a plus sign instead so this is something to keep in mind if you see this formula in textbooks or websites with a different sign convention so this is the formula for the for acceleration and if we like we can write out the components of the four acceleration as the sum of two column vectors which gives us this so the formula for the four acceleration vector is actually quite ugly the most interesting thing about the four acceleration big a is that it is not necessarily parallel to the three acceleration small a in the spatial dimensions xyz if the dot product small a dot small u is non-zero then the four acceleration components in xyz actually get another term in addition to the standard three acceleration small a so we now have four velocity for momentum and for acceleration the last vector we'll talk about is the four force capital f which is the rate of change of four momentum with respect to proper time tau where four momentum is equal to mass times 4 velocity if we assume mass is constant then we can pull mass in front of the derivative and the derivative of 4 velocity we know is just the for acceleration big a which we've already calculated so the famous equation f equals m a is actually four dimensional in special relativity it's worth noting that the time component of the four force vector is the derivative of the time component of momentum with respect to proper time since the time component of momentum is energy this is the derivative of energy with respect to time which is power so the time component of the four force is a power term so in summary in this video we learned about several four vectors in special relativity that all inertial frames agree on we started with the four position big s which in previous videos we called the space-time separation vector and this can be used to give us a notion of proper time tau when we take the minkowski length of a time-like 4-position vector we learned about the four velocity big u which is d big s by d tau and we learned that the minkowski length of the four velocity vector is always the speed of light c for massive objects the four momentum big p is defined as mass times the for velocity the time component of the four momentum is energy however for massless particles like light we have a special definition where the particle's energy equals its momentum times the speed of light the four acceleration big a is the second derivative of four position and it is not necessarily parallel with the non-relativistic three acceleration in the spatial dimensions and finally we have four fourths which is the derivative of four momentum with respect to tau the time component of four force is power all of these four vectors are invariant the geometric vectors themselves are agreed upon by all inertial reference frames but their components will look different in different inertial reference frames in order to change between the components of these four vectors in different frames we can transform the basis vectors using a lorentz transformation and transform the vector components with the inverse lorentz transformation just like we saw with the four position in previous videos we know that this is possible for all four vectors because all four vectors are written in terms of a space-time basis and remember basis vectors and vector components are two sides of the same coin when we change our space-time basis in one way the four vector components will change in the opposite way because vector components are contravariant so anytime we change our space-time basis using a lorentz matrix we know that we can change the components of any four vector using the inverse lorentz matrix by the rules of contravariance and covariance
