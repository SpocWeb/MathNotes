Welcome back to the video series on tensors. In the last video we covered forward and backward transformations. And in this video we're going to talk about our first example of a tensor, which is the vector. So what is a vector exactly? Much like tensors, you might get different answers to that question depending on who you ask. So this is one definition you might hear: a vector is a list of numbers, or a vector is a one-dimensional array of numbers. So that's a nice easy definition and here are a couple examples of vectors V and W and they're just lists of numbers. So you probably already know if we want to add these lists together, we just add them like this. Right? We just add the corresponding elements to get the new vector with elements V_1 + W_1, V_2 + W_2 and so on and so forth. So that's vector addition with lists. And you probably also know that we can scale vectors using a scaling constant like this. So we just take the scaling number "a" and give it to each number inside the list and multiply each number inside by "a". So this definition of a vector is easy enough, but there is a problem. And the problem is that these lists of numbers are actually vector *components*, not the vectors themselves. So if you'll recall I said before that vectors are invariant under a change of coordinates whereas vector components are not invariant under a change of coordinates. So it's really important to remember that a vector and a vector's components are really, really not the same thing and we should never confuse the two. So much like saying that a tensor is a multi-dimensional array of numbers... saying that a vector is just a list of numbers really misses the geometrical truth that lies behind the numbers in the list. Right? Because vectors are geometrical objects that have geometrical meaning. So this definition isn't really very good. So let's try again. Definition number two: a vector is like an arrow... just like an arrow floating in space. So this is a more geometric answer. We can draw arrows and we don't really need to refer to a coordinate system in order to understand them. And just like before, we can add vectors together. To do this geometrically, we just place the tail of the second vector on the tip of the first vector like this. Some people call this "tip- to-tail" addition. And the resulting vector is just the vector that goes from the initial point on the first vector to the final point on the second vector. Another way of thinking about this is that we are creating a parallelogram using the vectors V and W, and the addition of V and W is just the vector that points to the opposite corner of the parallelogram. So that's the vector addition under the arrow interpretation of vectors. And also just like before we can scale vectors. So if we take the vector W and scale it by 2 we would just get a new vector that points in the same direction but is twice as long. And again we can do that with any other number like 5 or 3/4 or PI or whatever number we choose. Also if we have some vector V and we scale it by "-1", that means that we keep the vector length the same and just reverse the direction like this. So that's the vector scaling under the arrow interpretation. So the arrow interpretation is pretty good. It makes it really easy to draw pictures and visualize vectors. You'll notice I've been using this interpretation all throughout the video series so far, and I plan on continuing to do that. But there is a problem here. And that problem is that not all vectors can be visualized as arrows. So unless you've studied a bunch of linear algebra this might actually be a bit surprising to you, because a lot of teachers just teach vectors as if they are arrows floating in space like this. So these arrow type vectors are actually just a special kind of vector called a "Euclidean vector". But there are other types of vectors out there that can look pretty different. I'm gonna leave that until another video to explain what I mean, but now just remember that not all vectors are Euclidean vectors. Okay so let's try one last time, and this definition says that: a vector is a member of a vector space. So what is a "vector space"? So a "vector space" is a collection of four things. The first thing is a set of vectors "V", which are the vectors themselves. The second thing "S" is a set of scalars. So these are the things that we use to make vectors bigger and smaller. The third thing (+) is some sort of addition rule that lets us combine two vectors together. So we could add say a vector V and a vector W and get some new vector V +W like this. And the fourth thing (·) is some sort of scaling rule, which I'm denoting as dot, and that lets us use scalars on vectors to change their size. Usually instead of writing a dot (·) I just write the scalar right next to the vector, but you could put the dot there if you really wanted to. So really, what all this means is that vectors are things that we can add together using the "+" addition rule and that we can scale using the "·" rule and a scalar. So this is a pretty abstract definition there's no numbers that we can do number crunching with and there's there's no pictures that we can draw. All we really have at the end of the day are a bunch of rules. So even though it's abstract, the reason this definition is so great is that there are a ton of things in math that can be added together and scaled. And even if we can't draw them as arrows, we can still apply vector rules to them. So if this definition seems a bit strange to you, I wouldn't worry about it much for now. I think it will make more sense in the future. For this video and many videos later on, we're just gonna stick with Euclidean vectors since they're easy to draw pictures with and easy to visualize in our heads. So now that we have some idea of what a vector is, let's talk about how vectors behave under a change of coordinates. So you might remember from the previous video, I had two coordinate systems: the "old basis" and the "new basis". And we figured out the forward and backward transformations let us move between them. So let's say we have a vector V sitting here in this space, and we want to figure out the vector's components. Well, since we have two different coordinate systems, we can measure V using two different bases. So let's start with the old basis "e_1, e_2". How can we write V as a linear combination of e_1 and e_2? Well it looks like we need 1 copy of e_1 and 1.5 copies of e_2. So I can write this out "V = 1 e_1 + 1.5 e_2". Now let's do the same thing in the new basis. So it looks like we use 1 e_1 tilde and 2 e_2 tildes. So "V = 1 e_1~ + 2 e_2~" And because I have the components now, I can write V as a column vector. So in the old basis the components are [1, 1.5], and I've put a little "e_i" down here to remind us that we're measuring in the old basis. And in the new basis, the components are [1, 2]. And again I've put a little "e_i~" here to remind us that we're measuring in the new basis. Alright, so how are these two sets of components related to each other? OK let's think about that... remember with the old and new basis the forward transformation "F" brings us from the old basis to the new basis. And the backward transformation "B" brings us from the new basis to the old basis. Now maybe that works with the components too, right? So let's let's try applying the forward matrix F to the old basis components and see what we get. Okay so that's not right. So what happened here? Did we do the math wrong? Like, what's up? So this might sound crazy but I'm going to suggest that we try using the backward transformation on the old coordinates instead. So let's give that a try. Okay so, aha! By applying the backward transformation on the old components, we ended up with the new components. So for basis vectors, *forward* brings us from old to new, and *backward* brings us from new to old. But with vector components it's the opposite! *Forward* brings us from new to old, and *backward* brings us from old to new. So what's up with that? Right? This this might seem really weird at first, but it actually makes complete and total sense. And I would actually be a little bit worried if this wasn't true. So to understand why this happens you'll have to check out the next video.
