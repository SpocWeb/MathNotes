in this video we're going to go into more detail about wide derivatives are vectors this video is mostly going to be an upgraded version of my video on vectors from my tensors for beginners series so I would highly recommend that you watch that one first if you haven't already so in that original video on vectors I talked about how we can take a vector V and expand it out as a linear combination of basis vectors so I have two sets of basis vectors here the old basis and the new basis and I can build a vector V using the old basis like this so that's one copy of e1 and 1.5 e two vectors and I can do the same thing with the new basis like this so that's 1 1 tilde and 2 e 2 tilde vectors so doing this with individual vectors seems really easy but what we're going to do in this video is the same process of figuring out vector components in a basis but instead of doing it for individual vectors we're going to figure out vector components for vector fields so here we have a vector field where there's a vector at every point in space but in this video we're going to deal with a slightly different type of vector field and that's a vector field along a curve so that means we define a vector at every point along a curve so we have a bunch of curves here and the way we get vector fields from curves is to look at the sets of tangent vectors to those curves so looking at tangent vectors gives us a vector field that's defined everywhere on the curve so we can think of a curve as a function that takes some input parameter lambda and outputs a vector capital R so we can think of the lambda parameter as being a bit like time and as time moves forward and increases the position vector capital R will change tracing out a curve in space as it goes along so if we want to get a vector tangent to this curve we just need to calculate the derivative or the rate of change of R with respect to the parameter lambda which is d R by D lambda and that will involve taking a position vector R of lambda and another position vector a small step away R of lambda plus h and finding the difference vector between them and dividing by H and then to compute the derivative we take the limit of this expression as H approaches so taking a curve and applying this derivative process gives us a tangent vector defined at every point along the curve so we basically have a vector field along the curve so you can see here that we have a Cartesian XY coordinate system and remember that in the Cartesian coordinate system the basis vectors look like this they're the same everywhere in space now what we want to do is to use these basis vectors to measure the tangent vectors along the curve and since there are an infinite number of tangent vectors along the curve you might think that measuring the components would be pretty difficult but it's actually really easy we just take this vector field D R by D lambda and expand it out in the Cartesian coordinates using the multivariable chain rule now remember these partial derivatives here these are just the basis vectors e^x and ey as we discussed in a previous video so if we rearrange this formula here I've basically taken this vector field and written it as a linear combination of these basis vectors here and that would mean these derivatives here DX by D lambda and dy by D lambda these would be the components of the vector field because they tell us how much of the basis vectors e^x and ey make up the vectors and if we use this notation here I talked about where c1 is equal to X and C 2 is equal to Y I can rewrite this chain rule as a summation using the Einstein notation and that lets us express the basis vectors and components a little more compactly so in the beginning of this video I talked about how taking a single vector V and expanding it into a linear combination of basis vectors e1 and e2 would give us the components V 1 and V 2 now when we have a vector field given along a curve given by D R by D lambda we can also expand it into a linear combination of basis vectors partial R by partial X and partial R by partial Y using chain rule and that means the components of the vectors would be the derivatives DX by D lambda and dy by D lambda so these two situations might look pretty different but they're actually really similar we have a vector that we're going to expand some basis vectors and finally the vector components so these situations are really pretty similar and if we want to use the Einstein notation we can also write things like this where c1 is equal to X and c2 is equal to Y so all of that might seem pretty abstract so let's go through an example so we can understand things better so we'll take a look at this example of a circular curve where the x-coordinate of the curve is given by the function to cosine lambda and the y-coordinate of the curve is given by the function to sine of lambda so this curve is just a circle of radius 2 centered at the origin and the vector field given by this curve is made up of these tangent vectors here so we can expand out this vector field D R by D lambda using chain rule and what we want are these components here so the derivative DX by D lambda is just the derivative of 2 cosine of lambda which is negative 2 sine of lambda and the derivative dy by D lambda is just the derivative of 2 sine of lambda which is 2 cosine of lambda so the vector field here can be written as this linear combination where these are the basis vectors and these are the components and if we want we could also write the components of this vector field in the Cartesian basis as a column vector like this ok so let's just see if these components make sense when lambda is equal to 0 on the curve we're at the point x equals 2 y equals 0 and the vector at this point should have components 0 2 and looking at this picture that looks like about what we would expect and here where lambda is equal to PI over 4 we're at this point here and the vectors should have components minus square root of 2 plus the square root of 2 and looking at this picture that looks about right and finally when lambda is equal to PI over 2 we're at this point here and the vector should have components negative 2 0 and again that looks about right so this column vector really does contain the components of the vectors in this vector field with respect to the Cartesian basis vectors now of course there's nothing special about the Cartesian coordinate system we can also look at a curve using the polar coordinates so we can again expand this vector field D R by D lambda using the chain rule but this time we expand it using the polar coordinates little R and theta and so we can rewrite it like this and again these would be the basis vectors e-r and e-theta meaning that these derivatives would be the components and if we rewrite things with p1 is equal to R and p2 is equal to theta we can rewrite this linear combination using the Einstein notation so again just as we can expand a vector V as a linear combination of basis vectors and components we can also expand the vector field D R by D lambda as a linear combination using the chain rule where these partial derivatives are the basis vectors and these derivatives with respect to lambda are the components and again we can write this even more compactly using the Einstein notation where p1 and p2 are the polar coordinate variables so to make this more concrete let's go back to our circle example we already have the circle curve parameterised in cartesian coordinates but we'll need to convert it over to polar coordinates in order to take derivatives so as you hopefully remember the little R radius variable is equal to the square root of x squared plus y squared and if we substitute these functions in for x and y we get this so the 2 Squared's become fours and we can factor the 4 is out and the cosine squared plus sine squared is just equal to 1 so this is just the square root of 4 which is equal to 2 so R of lambda is always equal to 2 which makes sense since this circle has a constant radius of 2 everywhere next theta is equal to arc 10 of Y over X and substituting these in we get this so the twos cancel and as you might remember sine over cosine is equal to tangent and arc tan of tangent well those are just inverse functions of each other so the arc tan and the tangent undo each other and cancel out so we're just left with lambda so theta of lambda is equal to lambda so the parameterization of the circle curve in polar coordinates is just R equals 2 and theta equals lambda which makes sense since it's just a curve of constant radius traveling around in a counterclockwise direction so given this parameterization in polar coordinates we can try to get the components of this vector field in polar coordinates so the component D little R by D lambda that's just the derivative of two which is zero since 2 is a constant and the component D theta by D lambda is just the derivative of lambda which is 1 so the components of this vector field and polar coordinates are really simple it's just 0 & 1 and again we can write that in a column vector like this so do these components make sense well the components are always 0 and 1 everywhere so the basis vector for little R always points outward from the origin and the basis vector for theta is always at a right angle to that R vector and the length of the theta vector is equal to its distance from the origin so since this circle has a radius of 2 the basis vector also has a length of 2 so these components 0 and 1 look about right all the vectors have no components in the r direction and they're the same length as the theta basis vector and that applies to tangent vectors everywhere on the curve so the components 0 1 makes sense so we found for this circle curve here we can parameterize it in Cartesian coordinates or in polar coordinates it doesn't matter which and for the vector field of tangent vectors which is given by D R by D lambda we can use the chain rule to either expand it out in terms of the Cartesian basis or the polar basis and in each basis we get different components for the vector field so really the main takeaway of this video is you already know that when we have an ordinary vector we can expand it in one basis or expand it in another basis and in each case we get different sets of components depending on which basis we use and the exact same thing is true for vector fields along a curve we can use multivariable chain rule to expand it out in one basis or another basis and we'll get different components for that vector field depending on which basis we use and using the Einstein summation notation we can also write things like this so I really hope you see the connection between these two sets of formulas we're really just doing the same thing we have a vector we have basis vectors and we have components it's basically the exact same thing the only difference is that for the case of vector fields we need to think about the basis vectors and the components at every point in space and we need to use chain rule to get things right but other than that the case of individual vectors and the case of vector fields are really very similar and in the next video we're going to show that just like ordinary vectors whose components are contravariant the components of vector fields are also contravariant because they behave in the opposite way that basis vectors do
